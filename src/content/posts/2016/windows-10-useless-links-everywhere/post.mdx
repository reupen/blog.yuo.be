I had repeatedly encountered useless links in Microsoft programs, and I knew
Windows 10 was no exception to this. Here I was in the Display Colour
Calibration applet, wondering what it exactly it does, when I saw a 'How do I
calibrate my display?' link:

![Display Colour Calibration](./2016-12-26--9-.png)

I thought the link would answer my question, but upon clicking it, I was shown
the main support page for Windows 10 (containing no specific information about
display calibration):

![Windows 10 support](./2016-12-26--10-.png)

Confused, I thought I'd try searching for the question in the link I had just
clicked. However, that only brought up irrelevant content:

![A search for 'How do I calibrate my display?' on the Windows 10 support home page](./2016-12-26--28-.png)

Having just encountered one useless link, I thought I'd have a nose around for
more. 'How does indexing affect searches?' was the next link I found:

![Indexing Options](./2016-12-26--11-.png)

Wondering where it would take me, I clicked it, and was greeted by the general
Windows 10 support page once again:

![Windows 10 support](./2016-12-26--12-.png)

What about this link to 'Learn more about Pop-up Blocker'?

![Internet Explorer Pop-up Blocker Settings](./2016-12-26--15-.png)

That one brings up content about SmartScreen Filter instead:

![SmartScreen Filter FAQ](./2016-12-26--16-.png)

How about 'Tell me more about power plans'?

![Power Options](./2016-12-26--17-.png)

That one takes us back to the now familiar Windows 10 support page:

![Windows 10 support](./2016-12-26--19-.png)

Here's another link – 'How do I know what security settings are right for my
computer?'

![Security and Maintenance](./2016-12-26--20-.png)

And, perhaps unsuprisingly, it brings up the main Windows 10 support page again
(though this time it wants me to 'share \[my] experience'):

![Windows 10 support](./2016-12-26--21-.png)

What about the Windows SmartScreen privacy statement?

![Windows SmartScreen](./2016-12-26--23-.png)

Apparently, there isn't one:

![We are sorry, the page you requested cannot be found.](./2016-12-26--22-.png)

And, lastly, how about this link to 'tell me more about User Account Control
settings'?

![User Account Control Settings](./2016-12-26--24-.png)[^1]

You guessed it – clicking it brings up the general Windows 10 support page:

![Windows 10 support](./2016-12-26--25-.png)

That is just a selection of the useless links I found – there were plenty more.
I don't think it's unreasonable to expect such links to go to specific content
related to the link text itself. Instead, you often get a generic help page,
where searching for the expected content yields nothing particularly relevant in
most cases. A poor show in my view, and all of these were found simply through a
few minutes of inquisitive clicking around.

    The window in this screenshot looks blurry because of some incompatibility
    with Windows 10's standard DPI-scaling mode.
