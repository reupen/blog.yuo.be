  I ended up sending back the Samsung SSD, and bought an Mtron MOBI 3500 instead.
  (After a bit more research I found out that the Samsung was somewhat better, but
  never mind it was too late by then). Installed Windows Vista on it etc., it did
  what I wanted.

  Today I installed the Windows Feature Pack for Storage 1.0

  update and restarted my computer.

I was greeted by the lovely message:

> DISK BOOT FAILURE, INSERT SYSTEM DISK AND PRESS ENTER.

WTF sprang to mind. I really wanted to blame the update I just installed, but
this is at BIOS level so I will have to put it down to a coincidence.

I restarted, checked everything was set-up/recognised OK in CMOS setup and tried
again. This time it booted like normal. Clearly I will have to keep an eye on
this...
