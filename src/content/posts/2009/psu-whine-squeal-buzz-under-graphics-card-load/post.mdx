I had it when I had a GeForce 9800 GTX graphics card - but it wasn't that loud
and happened in fewer situations. At that time I never realised it was coming
from my PSU, I just assumed it was my graphics card. Then I read about the PSU
issue. Then my GeForce GTX 275 turned up and the noise was happening in far more
situations and it was a lot louder. Then I double checked where it was coming
from and indeed it is the PSU..

[This](http://www.hardforum.com/showthread.php?t=1373313) was one of the more
informative things I read about it. But I'm going to blame my PSU since it
happened in some capacity with two fairly different video cards. After reading
lots of PSU reviews (jonnyGURU.com at least made that slightly less of a chore
:p) I've ordered a Corsair HX750W. Let's hope it can stop watching videos making
me feel like my computer is about to explode :p

## Update

My HX750W turned up. The great news is that it makes no buzzing at all under
GPU-stress (that I can hear). It also came in a velvet bag :o

But the bad news is some of its cables seem like they could have had a bit more
thought put into them. The combined EPS12V/ATX12V 8-pin/4-pin connector splits
off right at the end of the lead, so if you split it you end up with a stiff V
shaped thing, which is likely to get in the way of something. It doesn't look
like the image on Corsair's website, but <a href={_12v_png.src}>like this</a>
which I borrowed from Newegg. In my case, connecting it split resulted in it
blocking a PCI Express slot - though luckily I had enough space to connect it
with both bits joint together. If it split a bit further up the lead, it
wouldn't have be a problem. Though my old Antec Neo HE just had separate 4-pin
and 8-pin leads.

The other problem I had were the SATA power leads. The cable is flat and not
rounded, it is quite stiff and ends up bending outwards quite far which is no
good if your drives are close together and you don't have a lot of clearance
(which I don't). The way they bend out also gets in the way of using two sets of
leads in the same run to work around the clearance issue because the first lead
gets in the way. I had to rearrange my drives to get around this. My old Neo HE
did far better - it had sleeved, rounded SATA power cables which I was able to
bend sideways out of the way.
