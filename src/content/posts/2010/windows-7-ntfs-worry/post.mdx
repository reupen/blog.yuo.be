Out of the blue, my Windows 7 install decided to run chkdsk on my system drive
on startup (once). It didn't find any problems.

A little bit more digging revealed Ntfs event number 55 had been logged last
time the computer was on: "The file system structure on the disk is corrupt and
unusable. Please run the chkdsk utility on the volume \[volume name]."

Obviously a little bit worrying. Since chkdsk didn't find anything actually
wrong, I did a little bit of stress testing to double check for any stability
issues - but those seemed fine. The drive in question is a Samsung SLC SSD,
again no real sign of any issues there - S.M.A.R.T. data is OK, and actually the
normalised wear-levelling attribute is still at 99 (!).

So I decided to leave it at that and wait to see if it reoccurs. (Actually, I
decided to switch my SATA controller into AHCI mode which unleashed some
separate problems, but I'll write about those separately).

Occur again it did - several days later. This time I caught the message in the
event log before I shut down the computer. Indeed I checked the dirty flag of
the volume, and it was set. Similarly, chkdsk wasn't flagging up anything as
wrong.

Seemed to me that something must have changed recently to start triggering this.
There were a few things I could think of, but I simply disabled the real-time
protection of my anti-virus (MSE "Ongoing Beta"). Some weeks later and it hasn't
reoccurred - but that may well be a coincidence. Not sure what to make of it,
but I will have to continue to monitor it..

Update: The Windows photo importing functionality seems to be something that
likes to trigger this (see comments). Still investigating whether MSE is
relevant or not.

Update: It likes to happen when importing the photos but not always reliably. So
far it has only happened with MSE real-time protection enabled. The photo
importer is set to import to the "My Pictures" folder, and also picture
'streaming' is enabled. You might also get the dreaded
“{<a href={ahha_png.src}>The file or directory is corrupted and unreadable</a>}”
message as well. I will also add that I tested on Windows 7 64-bit.

Looks like an OS bug anyway, I don't see why anti-virus should cause this type
of error.

First one seems interesting, some issue with file locks according to it.

Update: A statement from a Microsoft employee from the
[TechNet forums](http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/fi-FI/w7itprogeneral/thread/df935a52-a0a9-4f67-ac82-bc39e0585148):
