  1. Surely a (laptop) recovery DVD that depends on the original storage drive
     partition layout to be (loosely) intact is a complete fail? I'm looking at
     you, Acer.

  2. Some people might call that a memory leak, Notepad++. I'll try version 5.7:
     let's hope it's better even if it doesn't make any specific promises about
     this.

  3. The hot fix for the Windows 7 erroneous file is corrupt nonsense

   this.

3. The hot fix for the Windows 7
   [erroneous file is corrupt nonsense](/2010/01/20/windows-7-ntfs-worry/) was
   [finally released](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/982927) a few weeks ago.

4. Some questions on notification icons (tested on Windows 7):

   - When pressing Enter on a focused notification icon, why are two
     NIN_KEYSELECT notifications sent to the associated application? (i.e. when
     using Windows 2000 or newer behaviour), Space was OK, as I remember.
   - In the main notification icon area, why are WM_XBUTTONDOWN/WM_XBUTTONUP
     notifications sent when the 'X' buttons are pressed over another icon?

5. Why do PC modern games still have problems with freely rotating mouse wheels
   (with non-120-multiple wheel rotation values)?
   [I'm looking at you, Dragon Age](http://social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/58/index/129370/LP).
   Even worse is to not bother fixing it.
