  As I know the nice person(s) at UPEK like to take notice of things posted here,
  I thought I'd write about a couple of new problems I had with Protector Suite /
  my fingerprint reader under Windows 7.

   1. A new error message appeared today; it was hiding under all other windows so
      it went unnoticed for a while:

      First time I've seen that one, so not an often occurrence.

   First time I've seen that one, so not an often occurrence.

2. Sometimes after resuming from sleep, my fingerprint reader doesn't function
   (no feedback when swiping). If I try to restart the Windows Biometric
   Service, it times-out or something, though after a while things work again.

   Perhaps the below message logged by Windows will help. There's also something
   for the Windows Biometric Service from when I tried to restart it, that's
   under Bucket ID 1376951512.
