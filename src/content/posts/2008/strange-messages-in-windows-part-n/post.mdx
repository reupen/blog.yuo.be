  So what does Internet Explorer have to do with copying a file? The source and
  the destination were both on my local computer. Actually, the source file was
  inside a Zip archive I downloaded, not using Internet Explorer though.

  Oh, and that icon looks a bit dated too.

inside a Zip archive I downloaded, not using _Internet Explorer_ though.
