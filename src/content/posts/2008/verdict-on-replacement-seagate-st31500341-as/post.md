It will also be going back, for a refund this time. This one hasn't completely
died like the other one, but it makes a click every time it powers up (the same
type as the other one did repeatedly when it died), and the reallocated sector
count is increasing slowly (on ten so far.. ten too many for a 2 week old
drive). I didn't bother installing an OS on it this time.

I don't know if the packing/shipping of the retailer has anything it do with it.
It came in a very tight air pack thing (the type where you would put the object
inside it and inflate it) and that itself was loose in a large box.

I also found out there are two versions of this drive, ST31500341AS and
ST31500343AS. More often than not it seems the former has SD1x firmware version
whilst the latter has SD3x firmware. Not much info around on the latter model.
