  The Vista on my laptop decided to go (literally) nuts a few days ago. Nuts, as
  in a few minutes after login it would half-freeze. Half freeze as in stop
  responding to keyboard and mouse, thrash the hard drive but still let some UI
  updates through (e.g. clock).

  This would obviously make locating the cause a nightmare. I did manage to cause
  some funky BSODs in this mode trying to hibernate (something like
  INTERNAL_POWER_FAILURE ?)

  Safe mode was working, but I couldn't see what I could to resolve

The Vista on my laptop decided to go (literally) nuts a few days ago. Nuts, as
in a few minutes after login it would half-freeze. Half freeze as in stop
responding to keyboard and mouse, thrash the hard drive but still let some UI
updates through (e.g. clock).

This would obviously make locating the cause a nightmare. I did manage to cause
some funky BSODs in this mode trying to hibernate (something like
INTERNAL_POWER_FAILURE ?)

Safe mode was working, but I couldn't see what I could to resolve this. Nothing
interesting in the Event Log, and System Restore had no checkpoints (probably
because I had it disabled when I was using XP and this install was an upgrade of
that).

So I decided to format and reinstall Vista. Alls well that ends well because now
Vista is far more responsive. It could be related to the recent
performance/reliability updates (which caused problems on my old vista install).
Or possibly the lack of junk installed that came with the laptop. What's great
is that coming out of sleep mode actually happens in a reasonable time now!
