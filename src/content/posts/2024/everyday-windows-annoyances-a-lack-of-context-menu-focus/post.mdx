  It won’t be a surprise that I noticed a new annoyance with the Windows 11 File Explorer.

import { PostImage } from "@/components"

import desktop_context_menu_cropped_png from "./desktop-context-menu-cropped.png"
import explorer_context_menu_item_colour_mp4 from "./explorer-context-menu-item-colour.mp4"

I recently noticed a new annoyance with the Windows 11 File Explorer and desktop
context menus. The colour of the selected items changes when right-clicking on
items:

{

<figure>
  <video
    src={explorer_context_menu_item_colour_mp4}
    height="1088"
    preload="metadata"
    width="1690"
    autoPlay
    controls
    loop
    muted
    playsInline
  ></video>
  <figcaption>
    Somehow, both old and new context menus manage to be a mess
  </figcaption>
</figure>
}

This problem doesn’t exist with the old context menu (accessed by holding Shift
while right-clicking, or by using the ‘Show more options’ item). The technical
reason the problem happens is that the keyboard focus shifts from the list of
files (called a list view) to the context menu, and so the colours used in the
list view change to indicate that it’s no longer focused.

But it’s obviously undesirable (and distracting) for that colour shift to happen
when displaying the context menu, and so the old context menu has special logic
to stop it happening. For whatever reason, that logic hasn’t been implemented in
the new context menu.

The problem is worse in other areas, such as in the left-hand pane in File
Explorer, and on the desktop. In those cases, the selection shading disappears
completely while the context menu is open:

<figure>
  <PostImage
    src={desktop_context_menu_cropped_png}
    alt="A screenshot of the Windows 11 desktop, with the context menu open for some items. There is no visual indication which items these are in the screenshot"
  />
  <figcaption>
    <span>Which items did I right-click on? Hint: It was more than one</span>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

This lack of attention to detail is prevalent in a lot of new functionality
turning up in Windows, and it’s sad.
