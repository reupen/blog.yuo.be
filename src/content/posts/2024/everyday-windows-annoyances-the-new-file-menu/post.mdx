When you right-click on the desktop or in a folder, one of the things you can do
using the context menu is create new files, folders and shortcuts. Here’s what
this part of the context menu looks like on a fully up-to-date installation of
Windows 11:

I always pause for a moment when looking at this menu. Because, at first glance,
it looks like the entries for creating new files (from the third item down) are
in no particular order. In fact, though, those entries sorted by something that
isn’t shown – the file extension used by that file type.

The items being sorted by something not visible makes it harder to scan through
the list to find the item you want. But is this a new problem? The answer is no
– the order of the items was the same in Windows 7 (though a useful dividing
line after ‘Shortcut’ has been lost):

<figure>
  <PostImage src={image_png} alt="The ‘New’ menu in Windows 7" />
  <figcaption>
    <span>Briefcases!</span>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

In fact, apart from a moved briefcase, the order was the same in Windows XP:

<figure>
  <PostImage src={image_2_png} alt="The ‘New’ menu in Windows XP" />
  <figcaption>
    <span>Simpler times</span>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Why are the items in that order? There’s a simple probable explanation: the
entries that determine what appears in that menu are organised by file extension
under the HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT key in the Windows Registry. The items are
presumably just being shown in the order they are enumerated from the Windows
Registry (and, as I get to the end of writing this post, I see that
[Raymond Chen has confirmed this](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20190611-00/?p=102581)).

There’s hope for Windows 12, I guess.
