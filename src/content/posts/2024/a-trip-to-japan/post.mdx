I recently went on holiday to Japan. It was my second time going – the first
time I went was a fairly rushed trip in 2017.

I (accidentally) booked during
[Golden Week](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Week_(Japan)>) – a week or
so when there are a number of national holidays, and hence domestic tourism. I
planned my itinerary around this to avoid the crowds, so it wasn’t a major
problem. It did also mean that there were a few things going on that wouldn’t
otherwise have been.

Anyway, here are some photos from the trip.

## Kamakura

## The Shinkansen

I took the Shinkansen (bullet train) four times on this trip, paying a bit extra
to travel in a green car (the equivalent of first class in the UK) on some of
those journeys.

Here’s the interior of a Shinkansen green car:

The green cars were very quiet on my journeys. In green cars, snacks, drinks and
a bento box are available to order on a mobile website that can be accessed by
scanning a QR code. (As I discovered, you have to be connected to the train or
station Wi-Fi to place an order – otherwise you’ll get a ‘Forbidden’ error when
clicking through to the menu.)

Items ordered are brought to you and have to be paid for by cash.

I ordered a special Makunouchi bento on one of my journeys, which was filled
with various food items from around Tokyo, Nagoya and Osaka. The black beans
(I’m guessing they were kuromame beans) were delicious (and unfortunately don’t
really seem to be available in the UK).

Mount Fuji was visible on my journey from Tokyo to Kyoto, and again on the way
back.

## Himeji

Undoubtedly, my favourite photo from the trip was of Himeji Castle, a hilltop
castle in Himeji.

## Kyoto

I prioritised places I didn’t go to in 2017 (and so some famous sights are
missing from these).

During my last evening in Kyoto, I visited Fushimi Inari Taisha and climbed the
steps up Mount Inari to the viewpoint at Yotsutsuji intersection. It was roughly
a 30-minute climb and the viewpoint was reasonably quiet at sunset (unlike the
lower parts of the shrine).

Unfortunately, I had an early start the next morning (to get back to the UK) so
I couldn’t stay at the viewpoint long. I did manage to snap a few photos, at
least.

## Being a tourist in Japan

There’s plenty of tourist advice online, so I’m only going to cover a few points
from my experience that might be helpful to others (particularly people from the
UK visiting Japan).

### Withdrawing cash

There are mixed reports online about whether you’ll be charged for withdrawing
cash from a Seven Bank (7-Eleven) cash machine. I did see some reports that
Mastercard cards don’t incur a fee. And indeed, I wasn’t charged to withdraw yen
using Chase UK and Starling Bank debit cards (both of which are Mastercards).

### Paying by card

I had no problem paying with a UK Visa credit card in restaurants and most shops
in Tokyo and Kyoto. In most cases, the transaction goes through in yen without a
currency selection step.

Contactless (called touch there) was only accepted at some places (maybe 50% of
the places that accepted credit and debit cards) but when it was available, it
worked fine with the Google Wallet app on my Android phone.

(I did discover though that the Panasonic contactless card readers I encountered
work from some distance away. When I first tried to use one, I did what I do in
the UK and held my phone several inches above the reader, waiting until the
reader was ready and displaying the amount before moving my phone closer. And,
of course, what actually happened was that the transaction just went through
while my phone was still several inches away.)

### IC cards

[IC cards in Japan](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2359_003.html) are similar to
Oyster cards in London (except that IC cards can also be used to pay for things
in shops, at vending machines and in other places).

<figure>
  <PostImage
    src={PXL_20240429_025222235_jpg}
    alt="A photo of train ticket machines"
  />
  <figcaption>
    <span>
      The machines that sell Welcome Suica card at Haneda Airport (plus some
      other ticket machines)
    </span>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

As my Android phone isn’t compatible with a digital IC card, I picked up a
physical
[Welcome Suica card](https://www.jreast.co.jp/multi/en/welcomesuica/welcomesuica.html)
from the machine near the monorail station at Haneda Airport when I arrived. I
paid for it with my UK credit card without a problem (though note that physical
cards can normally only be topped up with cash). (I didn’t bother trying to get
one of the normal (non-Welcome) Suica cards aimed at residents, as I was staying
for less than 28 days, and didn’t fancy the bother of having to return the card
to get my deposit back.)

### smart EX Shinkansen tickets

I booked my Shinkansen tickets using the
[smart EX](https://smart-ex.jp/en/index.php) website (which has some advantages
over other methods, such as discounted tickets and QR code and IC card
boarding).

Unfortunately, the site is particularly fussy about which cards it accepts. It
didn’t accept my UK Nationwide Visa credit card but it did accept a Curve card I
had.

I had no problem using the ‘designate IC card’ feature with my Welcome Suica
card. That meant I could pass through the Shinkansen gates using my Welcome
Suica card instead of QR codes (which I found a bit more convenient). (It wasn’t
obvious where I was meant to tap my card at one of the gates, but it was the
same place the QR codes are scanned.)

## The end

It’s a long flight from the UK (around 14 hours, as planes from the UK no longer
travel through Russian airspace). Perhaps I’ll go for a third trip at some point
though.
