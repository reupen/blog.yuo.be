  I gave Intel Application Optimization a go. And then uninstalled it.

I decided to try out Intel’s new
[Intel Application Optimization](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000095419/processors.html)
tool for 14th generation Intel processors.

Getting it working required enabling an option called Intel Dynamic Tuning
Technology in my motherboard’s BIOS settings (which was curiously in a menu
named ‘Thermal Configuration’), installing some drivers downloaded from my
motherboard manufacturer’s website, and installing the Intel Application
Optimization app from the Microsoft Store. The drivers include two services, and
curiously have INTEL CONFIDENTIAL in all the .inf files (presumably an
oversight).

After going through all that, I was able to run the Intel Application
Optimization utility without it displaying an error. Well sort of – it simply
stated ‘No applications have been detected’:

I tried starting various games I had installed, but the message persisted. The
example screenshot of the Intel Application Optimization utility on Intel’s
website has lots of games in the list of detected applications:

  <PostImage
    src={_95419_img3_png}
    alt="A screenshot of Intel Application Optimization from Intel’s website, listing numerous games in the list of detected applications."
  />
  <figcaption>
    <span>There’s even a scroll bar</span>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Search results online, however, show that only two games are known to be
supported – Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege and Metro Exodus. Neither are games
that I have.

Before the screenshot, Intel does say:

> Expanded view with detected applications list (example only). This list will
> vary for from user to user.

Presumably they’re hinting at the lack of supported games (ironically, though,
it means the screenshot isn’t actually an example as stated).

With it being seemingly useless for me, I decided to remove Intel Application
Optimization from my system. Disabling Intel Dynamic Tuning Technology in BIOS
and uninstalling the Intel Application Optimization utility are both easy. But
the driver package has no uninstaller, and getting rid of it and the associated
services is a faff. (I first disabled the two services, and then used the ‘Show
hidden devices’ and ‘Devices by driver’ views in Device Manager to remove the
devices and drivers. The entries for the services were then automatically
removed after a reboot.)

All in all, this thing seems more of a technology demo than a useful piece of
software. It’d need to be pretty compelling to convince me to install more
background processes, and some performance improvements for two games I don’t
play (or have) is not that.

### **Update January 2024**

Intel has
[stated in a CES 2024 press release](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/ces-2024-client-processor-news.html)
that there are now eight supported games. (As an aside, that press release also
has a link to an internal SharePoint site in the footer...)
[Another report](https://www.pcgamer.com/intel-to-roll-out-14th-gens-game-optimization-software-to-older-1213th-gen-hybrid-cpus-after-all/)
says support for a few more games is on the way. Let’s hope an official list of
supported games, and a driver package that can actually be uninstalled, are also
in the pipeline.
