  I was buying something online, using Firefox on my desktop. When I got to the checkout page, I thought I’d use the ‘Checkout with GPay’ button.

  Except, when I clicked on it, I got this message:

  Eh? I am in a browser. The message doesn’t mean I need on a mobile, because the same thing works in desktop Chrome or Edge (activating some weird modal dialogue on top of the page).

I was buying something online, using Firefox on my desktop. When I got to the
checkout page, I thought I’d use the ‘Checkout with GPay’ button.

Except, when I clicked on it, I got this message:

Eh? I am in a browser. The message doesn’t mean I need on a mobile, because the
same thing works in desktop Chrome or Edge (activating some weird modal dialogue
on top of the page).

There isn’t even a link to go back to the retailer’s site so that I can try a
different payment method.

(Even more confusingly, the Google Pay documentation
[suggests that error `OR_BIBED_15` has a cause unrelated to the error message](https://developers.google.com/pay/api/web/support/troubleshooting).)

Well, that’s a button I won’t bother clicking on again.
