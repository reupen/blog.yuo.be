It’s 2024 and full fibre still isn’t available in my area. But, just before
Christmas, these black boxes appeared on all the telegraph poles in my area:

Being on the telegraph pole, I first assumed that they belonged to
[Openreach](https://www.openreach.com/) (the part of BT that owns and maintains
the poles). A closer inspection of one of the labels hanging from the boxes
reveals a different answer, however:

<figure>
  <PostImage

    alt="A label on one of the aerial fibre nodes stating ‘COMM FIBER (sic)’."

    <span>The answer was in plain sight (alas, with the spelling error)</span>

The boxes belong to [Community Fibre](https://communityfibre.co.uk/) who are
rolling out fibre to the premises in my area (and had already been putting
leaflets through letterboxes). They’re able to use Openreach’s telegraph poles
by
[paying Openreach a licence fee](<https://www.openreach.co.uk/cpportal/products/passive-products/physical-infrastructure-access(PIA)>).
A little bit of online searching reveals these particular black boxes are called
aerial fibre nodes, and they’ll move to the top of the pole once they’ve been
connected up.

As yet, the boxes on my road haven’t moved up the pole. On some nearby roads
they have, though, so it probably won’t be much longer for my road. (Openreach,
meanwhile, are stating ‘by December 2026’ for their full fibre rollout to my
area...)

## Update 4 February 2024

The black box moved to the top of my telegraph pole roughly at the time of my
original post. Alas, it’s currently looking like Community Fibre have abandoned
the roll-out on my road, as their availability checker now states ‘Sorry, we
don’t offer service at the address you checked and we don’t have any plans to
build here.’

(Seemingly,
[I’m not the only one with such a recent change on the availability checker](https://www.ispreview.co.uk/talk/threads/are-community-fibre-stopping-build.41188/).)
