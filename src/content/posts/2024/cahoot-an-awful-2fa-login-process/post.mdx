  I’m happier when I can copy and paste one-time passwords.

I have a savings account with [cahoot](https://www.cahoot.com). Like most banks
and building society websites, when logging into your account on the web you
have to authenticate using a second factor.

With cahoot, that second factor is a one-time password sent via text message.
That, in itself, isn’t too uncommon. cahoot, however, make the process painful
in ways that no one else does:

- they manage to structure their texts in such a way that the Messages app on my
  Pixel 8 doesn’t offer to copy the code
- even if you go to the effort of manually copying the code from the text, they
  actively block you from pasting the code into their website
- the codes are overly complex – eight characters and alphanumeric. The codes
  don’t have a set format, so you’re jumping between letters and numbers (they
  don’t, at least, use easily confused characters like 0 and 1)
- the attributes they set on the `<input>` element cause browsers to remember
  every previous code, and offer to autocomplete it (particularly annoying in
  Chrome for Android)

(And, yes, they don’t offer any option other than an OTP via text for the second
factor.)

Here’s an example of one of their texts:

{

<figure>
  <PostImage
    src={cahoot_2_png}
    alt="A redacted text message from cahoot reading, ‘OTP to LOG ON TO YOUR ONLINE BANKING. Please call us if this wasn&#x27;t you. NEVER share this code, not even with cahoot staff CUPN****’"
  />
  <figcaption>
    <span>They even forgot to put the code into a sentence</span>
  </figcaption>
</figure>
}

And here’s a formatted example of the markup for the HTML input for the one-time
password:

```html
<input
  _ngcontent-ng-c528047910=""
  type="text"
  oncut="return false"
  oncopy="return false"
  onpaste="return false"
  aria-required="true"
  id="pwd"
  name="pwd"
  aria-label=""
  aria-describedby="oneTimePasscodeDacDescpwd"
  class="logon-textbox val-Otp ng-pristine ng-invalid ng-touched"
  minlength="8"
  maxlength="8"
/>
```

(Contrast that with the example on
[https://web.dev/articles/sms-otp-form](https://web.dev/articles/sms-otp-form).)

I now actively avoid using the account. (And once the current interest rate
expires, I’ll stop altogether. Parting with convenience isn’t always worth it
for me for a slightly better interest rate, as it turns out.)
