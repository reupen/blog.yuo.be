  Yesterday morning, I was greeted by this after logging into my Windows PC:

  Google Drive was asking me to sign inThis was the fourth time this had happened
  in the last couple of months. Each time, Iâ€™d right-clicked on the Start button,
  gone into Apps and Features, typed â€˜driveâ€™ in the search box, and uninstalled
  Google Drive. And yet, it kept coming back.

  So, what was going on? The fourth time I went to uninstall Google Drive, instead
  of searching for â€˜driveâ€™, I just searched for â€˜googleâ€™:

â€˜driveâ€™ in the search box, and uninstalled Google Drive. And yet, it kept coming

of searching for â€˜driveâ€™, I just searched for â€˜googleâ€™:

    â€˜driveâ€™, and it doesnâ€™t appear alongside other Google software as it doesnâ€™t

With a bit more of a careful look, I noticed there were two Google Drive clients
installed â€“ Backup and Sync from Google, and Google Drive.

Now, I used to use Google Drive on this PC. But that was years ago â€“ it wasnâ€™t
listed in Windows Explorer nor was it in the Windows notification area, and,
perhaps unsurprisingly, I wasnâ€™t particularly au fait with what Google are doing
with their desktop Google Drive clients.

As it turns out, there is
[a blog post from the Google Workspace team](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/07/google-drive-backup-and-sync-transition.html)
explaining how the client named Backup and Sync from Google is being axed in
favour of the Google Drive client (somewhat ironic, as Backup and Sync from
Google was a replacement for the Google Drive client that came before it).

Iâ€™m not a Google Workspace customer, and that blog post says nothing about
forced installations of the new Google Drive client on PCs (only that users need
to â€˜transitionâ€™ to it). Alas, forced installations appear to be whatâ€™s
happening, managing to leave both clients installed and people like me somewhat
bewildered.

Am I alone in suffering from these problems? A quick search, on Google, suggests
Iâ€™m probably not:

Iâ€™ve now uninstalled both clients and am hoping thatâ€™s the end of it. But all in
all, thereâ€™s plenty of room for improvement here.

(I should also mention that when uninstalling the new Google Drive client, it
refuses to proceed, because the client is running...)
