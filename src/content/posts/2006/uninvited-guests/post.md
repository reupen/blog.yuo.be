  Do nice hackers exist? Apparently so. One such hacker left a file on my web
  server with the following message:

  > "Birgun Herkes Beyaz Kefen Giydiginde Siyahin Degerini Anlayacaksiniz //
  CeNGiZ-HaN WaS HeRe FoR SGB-TeaM"


  How did he get in? What does the message mean? I don't know! I am just grateful
  he didn't do any real damage!
