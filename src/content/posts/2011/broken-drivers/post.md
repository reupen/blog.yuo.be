  Lenovo finally posted an updated driver - version 267.21 - for the Nvidia NVS
  3100M chipset in my ThinkPad T510. Unfortunately after installing it I was
  greeted with strange, but horrible, colour banding. Do they test these things? I
  also tried 270.61 from nVidia - which actually supports my laptop for a change -
  but alas, the same obvious problem was present. I reverted to version 260.63,
  which works fine.

  Lenovo also posted an updated Intel Wi-Fi driver, version 14.0.1. This one gave
  me BSODs

Lenovo also posted an updated Intel Wi-Fi driver, version 14.0.1. This one gave
me BSODs, I think when entering sleep mode. Back I went to the official Intel
version, 13.5.0, which seems to works fine.

And let's not forget the Bluetooth drivers which wipe your hard drive when
upgrading/uninstalling them. The only
[warning](http://www-307.ibm.com/pc/support/site.wss/document.do?lndocid=MIGR-70042)
you get from Lenovo is a tiny "Please back up your important data before running
the update." I have not bothered to remove them....
