  Recently, when using GitHub’s global code search, I noticed something amiss with one of the results:



  The file path of the result was somewhat confused.

Recently, when using GitHub’s global code search, I noticed something amiss with
one of the results:

{

<figure>
  <PostImage
    src={image_png}
    alt="A search result where the file path appears to be foobar2000/columns_ui-sdk/ui_extension.cpp/9060."
  />
  <figcaption>
    <span>A very confusing search result</span>
  </figcaption>
</figure>
}

The file path of the result was somewhat confused. Taking the path literally,
there seemed to be a directory named ‘ui_extension.cpp’, as if it were a file,
and a C++ source file named simply ‘9060’. After clicking on the search result,
however, it was apparent that the search result wasn’t quite correct – 9060 was
in fact the owner of the repository that the search result relates to and wasn’t
part of the file path.

Normally, the repo owner appears at the beginning of that line of text:

{

<figure>
  <PostImage
    src={image_2_png}
    alt="A search result where the repo owner appears just before the repo name."
  />
  <figcaption>
    <span>This code is actually very old</span>
  </figcaption>
</figure>
}

It was slightly bewildering that the repo owner could somehow be appended to the
file path instead. I looked at the HTML markup of the problematic result to try
and work out why this was happening. There wasn’t anything obviously amiss. I
then copied the text into a code editor to look for any invisible Unicode
characters:

{

<figure>
  <PostImage
    src={image_13_png}
    alt="A text snippet showing left-to-right marks appear either side of the real file path."
  />
  <figcaption>
    <span>9060 was suddenly back in the right place</span>
  </figcaption>
</figure>
}

There were in fact two – both Unicode code point 200E, which is a
[left-to-right mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-to-right_mark) used to
control text direction. But that just raised more questions: where were those
marks coming from, and why would left-to-right marks move text to the right?

I wondered if there were any invisible characters in the GitHub user’s username.
Nope – there was no trace of any anywhere. I then checked the search results for
another GitHub search whose username consists entirely of numbers:

{

<figure>
  <PostImage
    src={image_10_png}
    alt="Another search result rendering incorrectly, with the file path this time displaying as README/9061. The repo name is Spoon-Knife, and the content of the file is ‘All that&#x27;s missing is the fork. Heh.’"
  />
  <figcaption>
    <span>I do want more cutlery in life</span>
  </figcaption>
</figure>
}

Aha – the same problem was present. At that point, I started playing with the
browser’s DOM inspector. I noticed that that adding a letter to the start of the
username was enough to make the problem go away:

{

<figure>
  <PostImage
    src={image_11_png}
    alt="The previous search result with the username changed from 9061 to a9061. It now renders correctly."
  />
  <figcaption>
    <span>I did also try adding a fork emoji</span>
  </figcaption>
</figure>
}

It seemed like it was purely a rendering (rather than data) problem, so I turned
to the styles section of the DOM inspector. I quickly found the cause of the
problem:

{

<figure>
  <PostImage
    src={image_6_png}
    alt="Styles applied to the text, including direction: rtl."
  />
  <figcaption>
    <span>That look suspicious</span>
  </figcaption>
</figure>
}

There’s a CSS rule applying the `direction: rtl` style to the text (‘rtl’
meaning right-to-left). Disabling that rule fixes the glitch:

{

<figure>
  <PostImage
    src={image_12_png}
    alt="The previous search result now with the username in the correct place."
  />
  <figcaption>
    <span>Still without a fork, though</span>
  </figcaption>
</figure>
}

The last remaining question was, why is right-to-left text being used here? It
made little sense given the characters that were being displayed. I wondered if
it was something to do with the mobile layout. A good contender for the precise
reason quickly became apparent: it affects how text is truncated.

Here’s a search result (with the `direction: rtl` style) in a narrow window:

{

<figure>
  <PostImage
    src={image_8_png}
    alt="A search result with the repo name truncated from the left, followed by an untruncated file path."
  />
  <figcaption>
    <span>The odd text direction stuff did have a purpose</span>
  </figcaption>
</figure>
}

And here’s that same result with `direction: rtl` removed:

{

<figure>
  <PostImage
    src={image_9_png}
    alt="A search result with an untruncated repo name, followed by an truncated file path."
  />
  <figcaption>
    <span>
      If anything, truncating the directory name would probably be more useful
    </span>
  </figcaption>
</figure>
}

Mystery solved, I believe. I’ve reported the bug to GitHub, so there’s a chance
it’ll be fixed (sweepstake on when, anyone?)

**Update 13 August 2023**

The bug has now been fixed.
