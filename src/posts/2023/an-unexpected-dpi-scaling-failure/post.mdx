  Recently, I printed this colour chart using X-Rite’s i1Profiler calibration software:

  I was creating some calibrated ICC profiles for my printer for the first time using an X-Rite i1Pro 2 spectrophotometer. But something looked odd with the chart: the text was overlapping things it shouldn’t be. It looked suspiciously like a display scaling (DPI) problem that was managing to affect something destined for the printer.

  I decided to change the high-DPI compatibility settings for the program and o

Recently, I printed this colour chart using

I was creating some calibrated
[ICC profiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_profile) for my printer for the
first time using an X-Rite i1Pro 2 spectrophotometer. But something looked odd
with the chart: the text was overlapping things it shouldn’t be. It looked
suspiciously like a display scaling (DPI) problem that was managing to affect
something destined for the printer.

I decided to change the high-DPI compatibility settings for the program and
override the scaling mode to ‘System (Enhanced)’:

    Surprisingly, an obscure dialogue box in Windows has a cut-off sentence

With that done, a reprinted chart looked much better:

Alas, this instead caused scaling problems in the application itself. Oh well,
one can’t win them all.
