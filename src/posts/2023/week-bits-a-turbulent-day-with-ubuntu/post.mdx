This is my first ‘week bits’, where I talk about something (hopefully
interesting) that happened during the previous week. It’s an experiment, and I
won’t do one every week (or possibly ever again).

This week, I’m talking about Ubuntu, the Linux-based operating system. On
Friday, I turned my laptop on in the morning, as I do most weekdays, and there
were some unusual errors displayed while Ubuntu was booting. They read:
‘blacklist: Problem blacklisting hash (-13)’. That same error was repeated 33
times. I’d never seen these errors before, so ‘What is that?’ was the main
thought in my mind. Ubuntu continued booting without problem, so I ignored the
errors for the moment.

Once I logged into Ubuntu, and opened Firefox, I ran into another problem: it
wasn’t loading any web pages. In fact, I seemed to have no internet connectivity
at all. I checked the Wi-Fi status in Ubuntu and it wasn’t even connected to a
network. ‘That’s weird’, I thought. I saw one of my Wi-Fi networks listed and
manually connected to it, and my internet was back.

That, however, wasn’t the end of my Friday woes: later that morning, when I was
on a Teams call in Chrome, I flicked over to Slack and my display froze, flashed
black and then remained frozen. I still had audio so I stayed on the call, and
then forcibly rebooted my laptop after the call had ended.

When Ubuntu booted back up, once again it wasn’t connected to a Wi-Fi network.
This time I paid a bit more attention: my laptop was no longer seeing my 6GHz
Wi-Fi 6E network. It was still seeing my 2.4 and 5 GHz networks, and although
those ones were also saved, Ubuntu wasn’t configured to automatically connect to
them as it was for the 6 GHz network. I suspected some kernel and firmware
updates Ubuntu had installed the day before were the cause of the Wi-Fi 6E
problem. I had a quick look at the update logs, but I didn’t have time to
investigate further, so I just made Ubuntu connect to my 5 GHz network
automatically so I could get on with my day.

Then the afternoon came. Twice more my display froze. The first time I was using
Teams and Slack again, the second time I was just using Slack.

I’d had enough at that point and dug through the system logs, looking for clues.
And it didn’t take long to find some. There were loads of amdgpu ‘no-retry page
fault’ errors, all mentioning Slack, at the time of the last display freeze.
Bingo. I searched the Ubuntu bug tracker for that error, and quickly found an
entry, but for Ubuntu 22.10 Kinetic. It looked like the same bug, but I was
running Ubuntu 22.04, the latest long-term support release. There was a link to
the upstream bug for the problem, and the bug was introduced in kernel version
5.19, and fixed in 6.1.

I was confused about why this would suddenly start affecting me. So, I looked at
the Ubuntu update logs more closely: the kernel had been updated from version
5.15 to 5.19. That explained everything.

Based on what the amdgpu bug report said, I decided to update to the Ubuntu
linux-oem-22.04c kernel, which is based on the upstream 6.1 kernel. I also
manually updated some firmware images from the upstream linux-firmware Git
repository to see if it helped with the Wi-Fi 6E problem.

The kernel update solved the display freezes, but the Wi-Fi 6E problem remained.
I checked my router settings and noticed that the 6 GHz network was configured
to use a non-preferred scanning channel (or non-PSC as they are called). I
switched to a preferred scanning channel, and Ubuntu saw the Wi-Fi 6E network
once again. I also checked the behaviour in Windows 11 and it had no problem
connecting to the original channel I was using. Regardless of which one is
correct, I don’t really expect to turn on my laptop one day and find it won’t
connect to my Wi-Fi network. The polite thing to do would’ve been to warn about
the problem with the channel for a period of time before goign on to break it.

The last problem remaining was the unhelpful blacklisting errors on boot. A
quick search online showed those errors are also new in version 5.19 of the
kernel, and are caused by a BIOS bug relating to secure boot keys. But the
errors can, apparently, be safely ignored. So, ignore them I shall.

So, all-in-all, a turbulent kernel update, and I’m surprised Canonical is
pushing the 5.19 kernel to Ubuntu 22.04 with such a severe AMD GPU bug. No doubt
there are others running into the same problem, as I speak.

And that’s the end of my first ‘week bits’. Hope you enjoyed them.
