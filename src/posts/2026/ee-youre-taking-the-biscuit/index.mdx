  A pounds-and-pence biscuit, as it turns out.
---

Ten days ago, I received an email from EE stating that the price of my mobile
phone contract would be going up by £2 a month. That works out to a 19%
increase. (If that’s not bad enough, I know others getting increases of over
35%. EE have
[a page explaining the changes to price increases for customers on older contracts](https://ee.co.uk/help/billing-payments/guide-to-bill/price-change-explained)
like me.)

Okay, I’ll vote with my feet and switch to another provider. I requested a
[porting authorisation code (PAC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porting_Authorisation_Code)
from EE so that I could transfer my number to my new provider.

EE then sent me the following text:

> Hi Reupen. We've sent your PAC Code as requested, but it doesn't have to be
> goodbye.
>
> We'd love to offer you an exclusive online SIM deal with a whopping 30GB of

> £11.50 from March 26, £14 from March 27. Eligibility, credit check and terms

This so-called deal is £9 a month for, at most, two months and five days before
the price increases in March[^1]. It’s a three-year contract. They’ve left out
details of the price increase in March 2028. And, not that I’d want to, but the
link to take out the deal doesn’t work.

No thanks, EE.

(And yes, I really dislike where all the regulatory meddling with how price
increases are stated has led us. Having to work out percentage increases myself
is also not an improvement – both the absolute figures and the percentage change
should be given.)

[^1]:
    For those used to month-then-day dates, note that March 26 and March 27
    should be read as March 2026 and March 2027 here. And I think it means the
    end of March, but since the link doesn’t work I can’t double-check.
