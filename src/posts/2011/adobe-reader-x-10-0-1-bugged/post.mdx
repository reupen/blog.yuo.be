Yes - Adobe Reader X 10.0.1 has a large GDI-resource leak bug. **This happens
when the semi-transparent light blue search box overlay is visible.** If you are
in select mode, a chunk of resources will be leaked every time the text cursor
flashes. Otherwise, just scrolling around will leak a chunk of resources.
Eventually you will reach the default 10k limit. Lovely. Eventually my taskbar
responding.
