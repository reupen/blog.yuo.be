  Dear Broadcom WIDCOMM Bluetooth Software 6.2.1.2100 installer,

  Thank you for deleting every file you had access to on my system volume. There's
  nothing like seeing random icons disappear from your desktop one-by-one. It's a
  shame you left all my other drives alone, but one can't have everything.

  Yours sincerely,

[another report](http://forums.lenovo.com/t5/T61-and-prior-T-series-ThinkPad/Bluetooth-update-killed-my-Windows-7/td-p/226419) -
so the problem has been known (with earlier versions!) for at least a month.
Great...
