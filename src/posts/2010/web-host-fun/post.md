  So my web host blocked my IP address from the server my web site is hosted on...
  and are denying it/are uninterested in doing anything about it. Seems like I
  tripped some "security" measure trying to edit a large wiki page.

  So off I go to find a new host... which is always a fun process. Wish me luck.
