  I’d known hail to be a momentary phenomenon. This hail, however, was fierce, and
  didn’t seem to be in any rush to go away.

  It was late February and I was at the start of a hike up Loughrigg Fell
  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loughrigg_Fell] in the Lake District. The fell
  offers some stunning views of the surrounding mountains, lakes and land, and I
  was keen to put my new Canon EOS R camera to good use while I was in the area.

I’d known hail to be a momentary phenomenon. This hail, however, was fierce, and
didn’t seem to be in any rush to go away.

It was late February and I was at the start of a hike up
[Loughrigg Fell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loughrigg_Fell) in the Lake
District. The fell offers some stunning views of the surrounding mountains,
lakes and land, and I was keen to put my new Canon EOS R camera to good use
while I was in the area.

I’d picked a relatively easy route, starting from White Moss car park (north of
the hill):

I waited for the hail to pass and it gave way to some sunnier weather. I
proceeded to Loughrigg Terrace to start the main part of the ascent.

[There had been much recent rain](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/about-us/press-office/news/weather-and-climate/2020/2020-winter-february-stats),
with water still running down the hill. The ground was often boggy, and rocky
surfaces were slippery. There was strong, constant wind. There were also further
bouts of rain and hail on the way down.

Despite the less-than-ideal conditions, views were spectacular and the hike was
well worth it. Here’s a selection of photos:
