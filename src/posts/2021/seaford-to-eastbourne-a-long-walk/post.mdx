  I had some free time in mid-September, so decided to go on what seemed like the most picturesque hike that was relatively close to home. I jumped on a train to Seaford – a town in East Sussex, and the start of a clifftop walk all the way to Eastbourne.

  I picked a good day to go: the skies were clear, and the weather was glorious. Perfect for viewing the Seven Sisters – a series of chalk cliffs along the coast and the main attraction of the walk.

I had some free time in mid-September, so decided to go on what seemed like the
most picturesque hike that was relatively close to home. I jumped on a train to
Seaford – a town in East Sussex, and the start of a clifftop walk all the way to
Eastbourne.

I picked a good day to go: the skies were clear, and the weather was glorious.
Perfect for viewing the
[Seven Sisters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Sisters,_Sussex) – a series
of chalk cliffs along the coast and the main attraction of the walk.

Here’s the route I took (recorded by my Garmin watch):

The walk is fairly strenuous – you’re more or less constantly going up and down
steep hills as you walk alongside the cliffs, followed by a longer climb up the
162 metre-high Beachy Head.

I followed the
[directions outlined on the Saturday Walking Club website](https://www.walkingclub.org.uk/walk/seaford-to-eastbourne/index.html)
for the most part (there were a few minor diversions due to cliff erosion, and I
stopped following the route on the approach to Eastbourne as I was on a narrow
path that was somewhat overgrown and wasn’t giving me much fun).

Naturally, the hike was a good excuse to use my camera – here are a few snaps
from the day:
