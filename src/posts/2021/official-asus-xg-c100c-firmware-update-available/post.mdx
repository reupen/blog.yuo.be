I’ve had the Asus XG-C100C 10Gbps Ethernet card for a while but only really
started making use of networking speeds faster than 1Gbps when I recently bought
a QNAP QSW-1105-5T 2.5Gbps switch.

Since then, however, I’ve been having repeated network connectivity problems on
my PC, particularly after coming out of sleep (requiring the network adaptor to
be disabled and enabled in Windows). (The typical symptom would be web browsing
not working, despite the network connection showing as being connected.)

The chipset of the card is the Marvell (previously Aquantia) AQC107, and there
are plenty of reports that firmware updates help with similar problems. Marvell
make firmware updates available on their website, however, their update packages
only (officially) support a handful of cards and that doesn’t include the Asus
card.

To date, Asus hadn’t provided a firmware update. I contacted their support
yesterday asking about firmware updates due to the problems I was having, and to
my surprise, they’ve today made a firmware update available:

The new version is 3.1.88. This isn’t that new (the latest on Marvell’s site is
3.1.118), but my card came with 3.0.33 so it would still seem to be a fair bit
newer than that.

The download is available from
[the support page for the card](https://www.asus.com/Networking-IoT-Servers/Wired-Networking/All-series/XG-C100C/helpdesk_Download/)
– it’s still propagating through their site so you may need to go through a few
of the OS options to see it at the moment.

The process to update is to run `atlflashupdate.exe` as an administrator and
follow the prompts. I’ve just done this without problem – will now keep an eye
on things to see if my problems are fixed...

### 19 March 2021 update

OK, this version seems to be a dud. After coming out of sleep mode, I’m often
greeted by this (combined with no network connectivity):

</figure>

However, on another manufacturer’s website, I managed to find a copy of the
3.1.118 firmware update with support for the Asus card’s device instance ID. I’m
going to take the plunge and see if that version is any better. (If it is, I’ll
post a link...)

### 19 March 2021 update

I’ve gone through several sleep and resume cycles with version 3.1.118 and it
seems like it’s a winner.

I found the version compatible with the Asus XG-C100C on
[the support site for a thunderbolt Ethernet adaptor](http://www.sonnettech.com/support/kb/kb.php?cat=537&expand=_a13_b1063_a3&action=a3).
The file needed is _atlflashupdate_1.4.2_3.1.118.zip_, (SHA-256:
`3193b4c4a4c3dd9358304dd738ef1dd1a8014b26c9cb6bd211662b17ecd158dc`) and it’ll
update the XG-C100C without any modifications. (After updating, I had to
manually disable and re-enable the network adaptor to get things working again.)

(Note: As the file isn’t directly from Asus, use it at your own risk. I’ve
emailed Asus back to report that 3.1.88 is no good, but I don’t know what
they’ll reply to me with.)

### 1 April 2021 update

Firmware version 3.1.118 has continued to work well, and, so far, seems to have
fixed all the problems I was experiencing with the card.

Asus didn’t come back with anything useful – in fact they denied the newer
firmware version even existed.

### 24 July 2022 update

The _atlflashupdate_1.4.2_3.1.118.zip_ file on the site linked to above has been
replaced with a newer version which no longer supports the Asus card (without
modding).

### 15 December 2024 update

While investigating a problem updating to Windows 11 24H2, I realised that the
_atlflashupdate_1.4.2_3.1.118.zip_ file I previously mentioned included unsigned
firmware files that cause a
[Secure Boot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFI#Secure_Boot)) violation (when
Secure Boot is enabled).

I gave in and modded the official Marvell 3.1.121a firmware update to support
the XG-C100C. I edited `updatedata.xml` and inserted the required `<pciid>`
entry in the same group that it’s in for firmware update packages that do
support the XG-C100C. For my card, that meant adding a
`<pciid vid="1d6a" did="07b1" sdid="8741" svid="1043" />` entry to the group
starting with `<pciid vid="1d6a" did="d107" sdid="0001" svid="1d6a" />`. The
firmware update went through fine, and the card is Secure Boot compliant again.

Also, there are now V2 and V3 variants of the XG-C100C. Everything in this post
only applies to the original version of the card.
