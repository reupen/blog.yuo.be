I was debugging an odd-looking Columns odd-looking crash from a Windows 8.1
device. The crash was odd because it looked like it should be impossible with
the code in question – it was caused by a pure virtual function call when trying
to call a `IDWriteFont3` method.

The reason it was happening became obvious when examining the DirectWrite
headers. Compare the start of the declaration of the
[`IDWriteFont2`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/win32/api/dwrite_2/nn-dwrite_2-idwritefont2)
interface:

```cpp
interface DWRITE_DECLARE_INTERFACE("29748ed6-8c9c-4a6a-be0b-d912e8538944") IDWriteFont2 : public IDWriteFont1
```

…with the start of the declaration of the
[`IDWriteFont3`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/win32/api/dwrite_3/nn-dwrite_3-idwritefont3)
interface:

```cpp
interface DWRITE_DECLARE_INTERFACE("29748ED6-8C9C-4A6A-BE0B-D912E8538944") IDWriteFont3 : public IDWriteFont2
```

Notice anything odd? I did – they both have the same UUID as their IID. That
means, you can successfully query a COM object for the `IDWriteFont3` interface,
when it in fact only supports `IDWriteFont2`. _And that’s exactly what happens
on Windows 8.1._

Sheesh.
