  No, Sony, I don’t like my TV picture squished, stretched and cropped at the same time.

## September 2025 tl;dr

This is still a problem on my A84L, with the latest v6.8100 software.

If you have this problem and are just looking to fix it, here’s a summary of the
full post:

- Whether you get a distorted picture depends on which input was last active
  when iPlayer is launched.
- To fix the problem permanently for that input, you first need to get the input
  showing something at a 576i, 576p or 720p resolution. So, if it’s an HDMI
  input, you need to temporarily set the device connected to it to one of those
  resolutions.
- Then, on the TV, go to Screen settings (under Display & Sound on my model) and
  change Display area to +1 and Wide mode to Full.
- You can fire up iPlayer and check if the problem is fixed at this point.
- If you changed the output resolution of one of your devices, you can now
  change it back to the original resolution.

If you use multiple inputs on the TV, you’ll need to repeat the above for each
of them (at least if you tend to launch iPlayer while having that input active).

## Original post

I was recently using the iPlayer app on my Sony A84L Google TV. I noticed
something odd: people were looking rather slim.

Here’s an example from BBC series Asia:

</figure>

Sir David Attenborough is squished. But, conversely, the BBC logo in the corner
is stretched, and positioned more to the left than it should be.

Clearly, such scaling makes no sense for natively widescreen content[^1]. You
also can’t access display settings while in the iPlayer app, so it’s not at all
clear how to fix this.

Thankfully, the internet has some clues. First, Sony and the BBC have articles
hinting at the problem:

- [Why is playback cropped or zoomed-in on my Sony TV? | iPlayer help](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/help/issues/connected-tv/sony-cropped)
- [How to solve: BBC iPlayer picture is cropped and the full image isn't being displayed | Sony UK](https://www.sony.co.uk/electronics/support/articles/00286315)

Second, there are various forum threads discussing the problem. Here are a
couple:

- [Sony A8 BBC iplayer UHD images seem stretched/ jelly effect | AVForums](https://www.avforums.com/threads/sony-a8-bbc-iplayer-uhd-images-seem-stretched-jelly-effect.2436890/)
- [Sony A80J BBC iPlayer/Youview Catch up Issues - Sony](https://community.sony.co.uk/t5/android-tv/sony-a80j-bbc-iplayer-youview-catch-up-issues/td-p/3867976)

Only the AVSForum thread accurately describes the non-uniform distortion of the
picture.

The Sony support article makes the solution sound simple. But when it says
_‘Launch your TV app to watch broadcasted [sic] content’_, the discussion online
suggests that it specifically means TV via the built-in tuner (using an
aerial).[^2]

I didn’t have an aerial connected, so I bought a cheap indoor aerial and managed
to tune a few channels in. I switched the TV to one of those channels and
checked the Display area setting. _To my surprise, it was already set to +1._ I
checked iPlayer again, and the picture was still distorted. I tried changing the
Wide mode setting to Full instead of the default (which I think was Auto). That
didn’t help either. I fiddled around with various other settings, but with no
luck.

I parked the problem until today. I reconnected the aerial, switched to an SD
digital TV channel and changed the Display area setting from +1 to Normal and
opened up iPlayer. I played the same episode of Asia I had used to test earlier.
It was still distorted.

I then went back to the digital TV channel, changed the Display area setting to
+1, and played Asia in the iPlayer app again. To my surprise, the picture was no
longer distorted:

Here’s how it looks in the Sky Q iPlayer app, as a comparison:

That certainly looks promising. I then switched my TV back to the HDMI input for
my Sky Q box (which is assigned as the primary TV input on the TV) and played
Asia on the iPlayer app on the TV once more. To my dismay, it was back to being
distorted.

The logical conclusion is that the problem also depends on which input is active
when the iPlayer app is launched in some capacity. With the Sky Q box set to
2160p, the Display area and Wide mode settings are unavailable on the TV. So I
changed my Sky Q box to output 576p, changed Display area to +1 on the TV, and
fired up the iPlayer app. I now had more of the picture, but it was still
distorted (albeit slightly less obviously, as the logo had moved in a bit).

I then went back to the HDMI input for the Sky Q box, changed Wide mode to Full
and fired up the iPlayer app once more. Success. It was back to being
undistorted and uncropped. I set my Sky Q box back to 2160p, and checked the
iPlayer app again. It was still undistorted and uncropped.

As a final test, I turned on my Nintendo Switch, switched over to that HDMI
input and fired up the iPlayer app and played Asia again. It was distorted.

So, in summary, if you have this problem:

- you probably don’t need to get an aerial to fix it if you don’t have one
- the behaviour depends on which input is in use when iPlayer is launched
- getting an undistorted and uncropped picture specifically seems to need
  Display area set to +1 and Wide mode set to Full for a lower-resolution video
  mode such as 576i, 576p or 720p[^3] on the input in use when iPlayer is
  launched
- this is definitely nonsensical behaviour of the TV (and it’s quite frankly
  disappointing that Sony and the BBC haven’t properly investigated and fixed
  it)

The above is true for my A84L TV at time of writing (at least as far as I can
work out). There are several Sony TV series (including A80J, A80K and A80L) that
run the same software, so I imagine the above would extend to those too.

Hopefully, someone at Sony (or the BBC) will pull their finger out and fix this
properly. (With any luck, it’ll get fixed when they finally move this set on
from Android 10…)

[^1]:
    It reminds me of a ‘Smart’ scaling mode some old Sony widescreen CRTs had
    for 4:3 content, where the picture would be stretched non-uniformly to fit
    the screen.

[^2]:
    You can configure the main TV input to be a set-top box (or ‘TV box’ as the
    TV calls it) rather than the built-in tuner, so the wording of the support
    article isn’t particularly clear.

[^3]:
    1080i also allows you to set Wide mode to Full, but it won’t let you set
    Display area to the required +1 setting (instead the TV offers Full pixel,
    at least via HDMI, which doesn’t help with the problem).
