  Luckily, there was an easy fix via the domain registry.

import gandi_helpdesk_loop_mp4 from "./gandi-helpdesk-loop.mp4"

I transferred most of my domains to Cloudflare in 2022. But one domain, the .be
domain this blog is on, stayed with Gandi.net as Cloudflare don’t support the
.be top-level domain (TLD).

Since Gandi.net was sold in 2023, the renewal prices have been ever-increasing.
My .be domain was coming up for renewal, and the latest quote was €38.38
(including UK VAT) for a year. (Back in 2022, it was €14.96.)

Perhaps not surprisingly, I set about finding a new registrar for my domain.
Many registrars don’t support .be domains, so the choices are limited. I settled
on one that was ICANN-registered and had reasonable prices, and set about trying
to transfer my domain to them.

To transfer the domain, you need an authorisation, or transfer, code. You also
need to disable transfer lock on the domain, if it’s enabled. With Gandi.net,
the two operations are linked: you disable transfer lock, and then get the
transfer code.

Unlocking locking the domain with Gandi.net takes 72 hours. They stated:

> The process of unlocking your domain is currently being validated. It will be
> completed by August 24, 2025 11:14 AM (within 72 hours). At the end of this
> period, you will be able to access the authorization code. Until then, the
> domain remains secure. This additional validation step has been implemented by
> Gandi to prevent domains theft. We strongly encourage you to set up two-factor
> authentication (TOTP) to secure access to your account.

Given the stated intention of imposing a delay to prevent ‘domains [sic] theft’,
it’s surprising that I didn’t receive any emails from Gandi.net in relation to
disabling transfer lock.

Once the 72 hours had passed, the authorisation code appeared in the Gandi.net
admin portal. I placed an order with the new registrar to transfer the domain.
The transfer was rejected due to an invalid authorisation code. I queried it
with the new registrar, and they stated the code was rejected by the registry,
and to request a new one.

The Gandi.net admin site had a button for generating a new code, but it was
disabled (presumably it would be enabled after the stated expiry date of the
code, which was in two months’ time). So, I thought I’d create a support ticket
with Gandi.net to ask them to confirm that the code was valid, and to generate a
new one if possible. Alas, the authentication on their support site was broken
on all my devices. It got stuck in a failed authentication loop[^1]:

Luckily for me, the registry, DNS Belgium, let you request transfer codes right
on [their home page](https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en). I did that, and a new code
appeared in my email inbox seconds later. This code was in a completely
different format to the one Gandi.net gave me – it was five sets of three
digits, separated by hyphens, while the Gandi.net code was sixteen characters
long, consisting of letters, numbers and a random semicolon. I sent the new code
across to the new registrar, and the transfer completed successfully this time.

[^1]: This does seem to be fixed now, at least.
