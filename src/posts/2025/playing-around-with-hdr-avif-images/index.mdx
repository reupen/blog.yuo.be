At some point, I noticed various bits of HDR functionality popping up in Adobe
Lightroom. I had largely ignored them (somewhat thinking HDR is a bit of a
gimmick). Recently, though, I decided to have a play around with them.

I gave Lightroom’s HDR editing mode a try on a picture of Himeji Castle, in
Japan, that I took on a Canon EOS R full-frame camera. This is the SDR version
of that image – as I had previously edited it – exported using Adobe Lightroom
to an sRGB AVIF file:

<figure>
  <a href={sdr.src}>
    <img src={sdr.src} alt="An SDR image of Himeji Castle, Japan" />
  </a>
  <figcaption>
    <span>My favourite castle</span>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

And here is an HDR version of the photo, saved to three slightly different AVIF
files that you can toggle between in this widget (along with the SDR image from
above):

<ImageTabs
  client:visible
  images={[
    {
      src: hdr,
      alt: "Himeji Castle, Japan in HDR (with an AVIF colour type of nclx)",
      label: "HDR (nclx colour type)",
    },
    {
      src: hdr_gain_map,
      alt: "Himeji Castle, Japan in HDR (using a gain map)",
      label: "HDR (gain map)",
    },
    {
      src: hdr_jxl,
      alt: "Himeji Castle, Japan in HDR (using an ICC profile)",
      label: "HDR (ICC profile)",
    },
    {
      src: sdr,
      alt: "Himeji Castle, Japan (the image in SDR as I had originally edited it)",
      label: "SDR (as above)",
    },
  ]}

/>

When viewed with a compatible browser on an HDR display, the HDR images should
look just like the SDR version, but with more brightness and brightness
variation in the brightest parts of the sky.

But it’s also interesting to see how those images look in less favourable
scenarios – on an SDR display, or when viewed with incompatible software, for
example.

Compatible browsers are currently mainly some Chromium-based ones, such as
Chrome and Edge. For me, my Pixel 8 smartphone makes a good test device for
viewing the images correctly.

(Also, what I haven’t done here is intentionally fiddled with the colours of the
image to make them more saturated – HDR or not, I like my photos to look vaguely
realistic.)

## What’s the difference between the three HDR images?

The ‘HDR (`nclx` colour type)’ image was saved directly from Lightroom, with
‘Maximize Compatibility’ turned off. An `nclx` colour type means that, rather
than having a colour profile embedded in the image file, the image’s colour
information is specified using a few simple values in what is called the `colr`
(colour information) box. (Those values are called
[coding-independent code points (CICP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding-independent_code_points),
and libavif has
[an article on them in the context of AVIF](https://github.com/AOMediaCodec/libavif/wiki/CICP).)

The ‘HDR (gain map)’ image was saved directly from Lightroom, with ‘Maximize
Compatibility’ turned on. The file actually contains two images – an SDR base
image and an HDR
[gain map](https://helpx.adobe.com/uk/camera-raw/using/gain-map.html). (This
means the file is larger than a pure SDR or HDR image.)

The advantage of using a gain map is that you have more control over what the
image looks like when displayed in SDR (or by something that doesn’t understand
the gain map). In practice, though, I had to fiddle around quite a bit in
Lightroom to get the SDR base image looking close to what I had before HDR
editing mode was turned on (and even then, there are still some noticeable
differences).

The ‘HDR (ICC profile)’ image, uses a colour type of `rICC` and contains an ICC
profile. I created the image by exporting the photo to a lossless JPEG XL file
(using Lightroom) and then converting that to an AVIF file using the libvips
`heifsave` CLI command.

If you want to find some details about how colour information is specified in an
AVIF file, [ExifTool](https://exiftool.org/) and `avifdec` (from
[libavif](https://github.com/AOMediaCodec/libavif)) can do the job. With
`ExifTool`, you can run (for example):

```shell
exiftool -g -Quicktime:all -ICC_Profile:all <file>
```

With `avifdec`, you can run:

```shell
avifdec --info <file>
```

That will give you the raw numeric values for some of the properties (which can
be looked up in the
[libavif source code](https://github.com/AOMediaCodec/libavif/blob/ec3fe0c5048c4c88b5d2bd95efdc6ff8cc7d4118/include/avif/avif.h#L335),
the non-free ISO/IEC 23091-2 standard, or
[the public H.273 standard](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-H.273/en)), and will
also provide gain map information.

## How do the HDR images look in different browsers and software?

On my Pixel 8 and Windows 11 laptop (with a built-in DisplayHDR 400 screen, and
HDR turned on in Windows), the `nclx` and ICC profile images appear to look
identical in Chrome (compression artefact differences aside). The gain map
version has a few oddities, though. On Chrome stable on my laptop and in Chrome
Dev and Canary on my Pixel 8, the gain map image has a very slight colour shift
in the sky (not easily noticed, admittedly).

In Chrome stable and Chrome Beta on my Pixel 8, the gain map image is marginally
darker than the other two HDR images for some reason. But there’s an even
weirder problem with the gain map image in Chrome – when you zoom in, odd grid
lines appear[^1]:

<CaptionedImage
  src={chrome_gain_map_grid_lines}
  alt="A screenshot of the gain map image zoomed in on this post in Chrome on my Pixel 8"
  caption="I assume this was tested"
  class="limit-height-slightly"
/>

And on Windows 11 on my desktop (with a DisplayHDR 400 monitor, and HDR turned
on in Windows), all versions of Chrome seem to display all three HDR images
slightly differently for some reason. (Whether the three HDR images should
technically look the same when viewed in HDR, I don’t know. From a user
perspective, though, I would’ve expected them to.) Also,
[be aware of how HDR brightness is handled in Chrome on Windows](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monitors/comments/17ases4/chromium_hdr_is_now_relative_to_sdr_brightness/).

What about Firefox? It doesn’t support HDR images at all and
[displays the `nclx` colour type image very darkly](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1793091).
With the gain map version, you at least get the (mostly) good SDR base image.
(The ICC profile image isn’t terrible either, but it’s a bit darker than gain
map and SDR images and has an odd slight colour cast.)

Of the three HDR images, the Windows 11 Photos app renders only the `nclx` one
in HDR. (HDR in Windows is also a bit of a pain, as you have to manually turn it
on, which makes everything including your desktop look different.)

In a web context, image processing tools are also relevant. I typically use
[libvips](https://www.libvips.org/) (often via
[sharp](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/)) to generate
[responsive images](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Responsive_images)
on my websites. libvips currently
[does not support the `nclx` colour type](https://github.com/libvips/libvips/issues/3912)
or [gain maps](https://github.com/libvips/libvips/issues/3799). And so, if I
want to create responsive images from a source HDR AVIF file using libvips, I
have to avoid the `nclx` colour type and ensure the image has a colour profile
embedded (for now, at least). (Unfortunately, I haven’t been able to get sharp
to handle an HDR image correctly at all, but that’s not the end of the world as
I can use libvips directly.)

## Wrapping up

The reality is support for HDR images is (currently) variable and inconsistent.
So, having an SDR version of an image (whether separate or via a gain map) is
important if you want your images to look good.

In Lightroom, for most images, enabling HDR editing mode preserved the existing
look of the image while extending the brightness range. For some images, though,
enabling HDR editing mode completely changed the look of the image and I
struggled to get it back to how it was before. (This mainly seemed to happen
with images where I’d previously fiddled with the tone curve.) And, even in the
cases where Lightroom preserved the general look of the image after enabling HDR
editing mode, the SDR rendition of the HDR image (seen when enabling ‘Preview
for SDR Display’) had still changed quite a bit (affecting how the image looks
in SDR if going down the gain map approach). Perhaps, if you start out editing
an image in HDR mode, you’d be less bothered by these points.

I also feel that ‘Maximize Compatibility’ is a bit of a misnomer in Lightroom.
The reality is that not everything supports gain maps (and there still seem to
be some kinks being worked out).

There are also web-specific concerns when it comes to HDR images, like:

- having the tooling to generate responsive HDR images
- being able to change behaviour depending on browser support (whether to pick
  the correct image to use, or to give users an option for whether they want to
  see HDR images)
- dealing with inconsistent behaviour between browsers, operating systems and
  HDR displays
- file size-related concerns (whether it’s the built website being bigger, or
  users being served more data)

One concern I had with gain maps is how a user could still be allowed to select
between an SDR and an HDR version of the image. The new
[`dynamic-range-limit` CSS property](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-hdr-1/#the-dynamic-range-limit-property)
appears to solve that, at least.

Perhaps surprisingly, given those points, I recently added some HDR images to
[my photos site](https://photos.reupen.uk/). For now, it’s using separate SDR
and HDR images, with a control to toggle between the two appearing when using a
Chromium-based browser with an HDR display (detected using a combination of
[`navigator.userAgentData.brands`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NavigatorUAData/brands)[^2]
and the
[`dynamic-range` media query](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/dynamic-range)).

(For what it’s worth, I do like having the extra brightness range of HDR images
available, and it seems silly for my camera photos to be disadvantaged compared
to smartphone photos that have been saved in an HDR image format.)

[^1]:
    This was seen on my Pixel 8 on all channels of Chrome. I haven’t seen it on
    Chrome on Windows.

[^2]:
    No, I don’t really want to use the browser brand in this way. Alas, the
    `dynamic-range` media query by itself doesn’t tell me if the browser
    supports HDR images (let alone which HDR image formats…)
