import { CaptionedImage } from "@/components"

import hearts_file_explorer_png from "./hearts-file-explorer.png"
import hearts_notepad_png from "./hearts-notepad.png"
import hearts_start_menu_png from "./hearts-start-menu.png"
import keycap_png from "./keycap.png"

Take the sequence of ❤❤︎❤️. This is U+2764 (HEAVY BLACK HEART) in default,
explicit text (monochrome) presentation and explicit emoji (colourful)
presentation.

Here’s how that sequence of emojis renders in two different places in File
Explorer:

<CaptionedImage
  src={hearts_file_explorer_png}
  alt="A screenshot of File Explorer showing three monochrome hearts in the main items area and three colour hearts in the details pane"
  caption="The inconsistency starts"
/>

Here’s how it renders in Notepad (in a tab and in the main typing area):

<CaptionedImage
  src={hearts_notepad_png}
  alt="A screenshot of Notepad showing three colour hearts in a tab and two black hearts followed by a colour heart in the main typing area"
  caption="Look closely, and you’ll also see that the red heart in the tab is not the same as the one in the typing area"
/>

And here’s how it renders in the Start Menu search box and search results:

<CaptionedImage
  src={hearts_start_menu_png}
  alt="A screenshot of the Start Menu after performing a search, showing three colour hearts in the search box and a colour heart following by a white heart and another colour heart in the search results area"
  caption="Some features in Window 11 use React Native and WebViews, causing more inconsistency"
/>

That’s no less than five different renderings of the same sequence of emojis.

The basic reason for the differences is relatively simple: there’s a mix of
technologies at play, including Win32, GDI, Uniscribe, DirectWrite, Direct2D,
[RichEditD2D](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/math-in-office/richeditd2d-window-controls/)
controls and WebView controls.

The first relevant difference between those technologies is that they support
different sets of glyph formats (such as normal monochrome glyphs,
[COLR glyphs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/typography/opentype/spec/colr)
and
[SVG glyphs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/typography/opentype/spec/svg)),
causing different glyphs for U+2764 from the Segoe UI Emoji font to be used.

Support for
[emoji variation selectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji#Emoji_versus_text_presentation)
also affects how the second and third hearts render. Some emojis (such as ❤)
have both text (monochrome) and emoji forms under the same code point. The two
forms can be explicitly selected between by following the emoji code point by a
variation selector (U+FE0E for the text form, and U+FE0F for the emoji form).
However, most of the technologies previously mentioned don’t support emoji
variation selectors, causing all three hearts to render identically. WebViews
and seemingly RichEditD2DPT controls do support emoji variation selectors and
hence render the two different forms of the emoji in question.

Also note that when variation selectors are supported, the typical approach is
to use Segoe UI Symbol for text presentation and Segoe UI Emoji for emoji
presentation. This results in the text and emoji forms looking inconsistent (as
the emojis in the two fonts do not have the same design). This inconsistent
appearance also happens on Android, so perhaps isn’t that unexpected. It is,
however, annoying, as Segoe UI Emoji has monochrome glyphs that are similar in
design to the colour glyphs but are generally inaccessible in applications
unless colour glyphs are disabled completely.

Lastly, those technologies don’t all agree on what the default presentation of ❤
is. According to the Unicode standard, ❤ has a text (monochrome) presentation by
default (though the standard
[allows varying default presentation modes depending on the purpose of the application e.g. suggesting chat apps could default to emoji presentation](https://unicode-org.github.io/unicode-reports/tr51/tr51.html#Presentation_Style)).
Notepad sticks with a default text presentation, while DirectWrite itself uses a
default emoji presentation for that emoji for some reason.

There are other weird things that happen with some emoji sequences. Take this
Start Menu search for 7️⃣7️⃣, for example:

<CaptionedImage
  src={keycap_png}
  alt="A screenshot of the Start Menu showing incorrectly rendered keycap emojis, such as with overlapping boxes and numbers"
  caption="No idea what’s going on here"
/>

As a user, this all just looks like a mess. As a developer, it’s frustrating
that DirectWrite does not support variation selectors out of the box, and that
the subject is not touched on in the documentation for DirectWrite.

And, why do Direct2D-rendered SVG glyphs tend to have horrible jagged edges?
Firefox does a much better job, for example.
