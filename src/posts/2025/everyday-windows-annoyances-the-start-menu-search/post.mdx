import start_menu_png from "./start-menu.png"

The other day, when I wanted to open the Windows Settings app, I did what I
often do and pressed the Windows key and started typing ‘settings’.

This is what appeared after typing a few letters:

<CaptionedImage
  src={start_menu_png}
  alt="A screenshot of a search for ‘sett’ in the Start Menu, with Settings, Component of Microsoft Windows as the first result."
  caption="Do you want Settings, or Settings?"
/>

I pressed the Enter key on my keyboard.

Microsoft Edge opened, with the Bing search results for ‘Settings’ open:

<CaptionedImage
  src={bing_png}
  alt="A screenshot of the Bing search results for Settings, including a block of text describing the Settings app."
  caption="Is that an AI overview, telling me to search the Start Menu for ‘Settings’?"
/>

Yes, Microsoft, _that_ is what I wanted to do.
