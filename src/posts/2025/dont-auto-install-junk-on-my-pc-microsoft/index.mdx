import { CaptionedImage } from "@/components"

import advanced_options_png from "./advanced-options.png"
import energy_monitor_jpg from "./energy-monitor.avif"
import microsoft_365_copilot_home_png from "./microsoft-365-copilot-home.png"
import system_tray_tooltip_png from "./system-tray-tooltip.png"
import system_tray_png from "./system-tray.png"

At some point in the semi-recent past, this icon appeared in the Windows 11
system tray:

<CaptionedImage
  src={system_tray_png}
  alt="A screenshot of the system tray with the hidden icons area open."
  caption="Yes, we all want AI shoved down our throats"
/>

I assumed it was an icon for Copilot. On closer inspection, though, it’s an icon
for ‘Microsoft 365 Copilot’:

<CaptionedImage
  src={system_tray_tooltip_png}
  alt="A screenshot of the system tray with the tooltip for the Microsoft 365 Copilot icon visible."
  caption="Not just Microsoft 365, but Microsoft 365 Copilot"
/>

I don’t like having things start unnecessarily when I log into Windows, so I
regularly use
[Sysinternals Autoruns](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/sysinternals/downloads/autoruns)
to keep the list of start-up apps clean. Microsoft 365 Copilot was nowhere to be
seen in Autoruns, though, so it had sneaked through all those clean-ups.

Another thing I sometimes do is use an old energy monitor[^1] to check (and try
to minimise) the power usage of my PC when idling on the desktop. It will give
me a real-time reading in watts, like this:

<CaptionedImage
  src={energy_monitor_jpg}
  alt="A photo of an energy monitor with a passthrough socket, reading 58W"
  caption="I wish I could read it without getting under my desk"
  class="limit-height"
/>

I discovered that closing Microsoft 365 Copilot (just by right-clicking on the
icon and selecting the ‘Quit Microsoft 365 Copilot’ menu item) reduced the idle
power usage from around 63W to around 58W. So, this thing that was
auto-installed on my PC, and starts itself automatically, was adding around 5W
to my PC’s idle power usage for no useful purpose.

Since there was no trace of this thing in Autoruns, I did a search online to see
if any anyone else had worked out how to stop it starting automatically. I found
people
[asking the same question](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/disable-both-copilot-and-ms-365-copilot-from/cf793a60-4eb2-4e4b-9aec-3170afca0982),
but without any working solutions.

I then found ‘Microsoft 365 Copilot’ listed in the Installed apps page in the
Windows Settings app, and I was almost ready to uninstall it. I did a bit more
fiddling instead, though, and managed to stop it starting itself automatically.

I believe what stopped it starting automatically is enabling and disabling ‘Runs
at log-in [sic]’ on this page for the app in the Windows Settings app:

<CaptionedImage
  src={advanced_options_png}
  alt="A screenshot of the page for the Microsoft 365 Copilot app in the Windows Settings app"
  caption="The verb is log in, and the noun is login, Microsoft"
/>

That page can be accessed via the ‘App settings’ command for ‘Microsoft 365
Copilot’ in the Start Menu, or via the ‘Advanced options’ command for the app on
the ‘Installed apps’ page in the Settings app.

(The other thing I did was open the Microsoft 365 Copilot app and log into it
with my Microsoft account, but I’m doubtful that was the action that stopped it
starting automatically.)

Problem solved (for now at least).

## What is this thing, anyway?

If you’re wondering what the Microsoft 365 Copilot app is, here’s what it looks
like (once logged in):

<CaptionedImage src={microsoft_365_copilot_home_png} alt="TO DO" />

It’s essentially a launcher for Office apps, with a Copilot chat section as a
bonus.
