A few months ago, I was nosing around the Windows Game Bar and came across a
section in its settings named ‘Gaming features’. Against various local drives,
it had a message saying ‘BypassIO not supported due to driver: aksdf’:

<CaptionedImage

  class="limit-height-slightly"
/>

That didn’t sound like a good thing. But what was aksdf? Searching for ‘aksdf’
in [Autoruns](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/sysinternals/downloads/autoruns)
found `aksdf.sys` at `C:\Windows\System32\drivers`. Inspecting the file’s
properties showed that it had a file description of ‘Safenet Inc. Sentinel Data
Filter Driver’, and was signed by a company named Gemalto, Inc.:

    },
  ]}
/>

A little more digging revealed that the driver was originally developed by a
company called Aladdin Knowledge Systems (presumably, the ‘aks’ in the driver
filename is an abbreviation of this). Aladdin Knowledge Systems was acquired by
Vector Capital who then folded Aladdin into another of their companies, SafeNet.
SafeNet was later acquired by Gemalto.

Gemalto was then acquired by Thales Group, and the driver is now part of the
[Sentinel License Development Kit (LDK)](https://cpl.thalesgroup.com/software-monetization/license-development-kit-ldk).
Back in the Aladdin days, the driver was part of a product line called Hardware
Against Software Piracy (HASP)[^1]. Part of that product line let companies
protect software against piracy by requiring a physical dongle to be connected
to the PC while using the software. (There were software-only solutions as well,
however.)

Okay, but why was this driver on my PC? I didn’t have any obvious clues, but
(and I forget how) I managed to track it down to X-Rite i1Profiler, the main
software for my X-Rite spectrophotometer. Apparently, at some point in time, you
could buy a licence for iProfiler in the form of a USB dongle. This was aimed at
people with older (or perhaps more basic) X-Rite products that didn’t come with
i1Profiler when purchased (but instead some other worse and presumably older
software). The X-Rite support site once contained lots of references to the
Sentinel drivers, but seemingly most of the relevant pages have been hidden from
public view
([the Wayback Machine has some of them, though](https://web.archive.org/web/20240614223120/https://www.xrite.com/service-support/usb_dongle_not_recognized_by_i1profiler)).

Annoyingly, uninstalling i1Profiler doesn’t remove the Sentinel drivers from
your PC.[^2] It can be done properly, though, using the installer for the
drivers.

The installer for the drivers is a file named `haspdinst.exe`. One way of
getting it is to extract the i1Profiler installer using
[Inno Setup Unpacker](https://sourceforge.net/projects/innounp/). But, it’s
easier just to
[download the latest version of the Sentinel LDK installer from Thales’s support site](https://supportportal.thalesgroup.com/csm?id=kb_article_view&sys_kb_id=979a4e21db92e78cfe0aff3dbf9619c6&sysparm_article=KB0018319).

Running `haspdinst.exe -info` shows a dialogue box containing a list of the
installed Sentinel drivers and their versions, and a list of the driver versions
included in the installer[^3]:

<CaptionedImage

  alt="A dialogue box containing a list of the installed Sentinel drivers and their versions, and a list of the driver versions included in the installer."
  caption="Oo-er, there’s a fridge too"
  class="limit-height-slightly"
/>

The drivers can be fully removed by running:

```shell
haspdinst.exe -kp -purge
```

(The available arguments can be found by running `haspdinst.exe -help`. They’re
also
[covered in the online documentation](https://docs.sentinel.thalesgroup.com/ldk/LDKdocs/Install/Installation%20Guide/RTE_using_Utility/haspdinst.exe%20Utility.htm).
Oddly, the `-purge` argument is not mentioned in either of those, but it
features in
[this support article about a legacy hardlock.sys driver](https://supportportal.thalesgroup.com/csm?id=kb_article_view&sys_kb_id=7cb5e3109703c9109fd638d3f153af4e&sysparm_article=KB0025777),
for example.)

Once that command has finished removing the drivers, a dialogue box saying
‘Operation successfully completed’ will appear. You can run
`haspdinst.exe -info` again to double-check that the drivers are gone:

<CaptionedImage
  src={sentinel_drivers_removed}
  alt="A dialogue box containing a list of the installed Sentinel drivers that aren’t installed, and a list of the driver versions included in the installer."
  caption="Aladdin and his fridge are gone"
  class="limit-height-slightly"
/>

And, of course, you can look at Gaming features again in the Game Bar settings
to check if the BypassIO message has changed:

<CaptionedImage
  src={game_bar_bypass_io_fixed}
  alt="The Gaming features section of Windows Game Bar settings, now saying ‘DirectStorage supported’ for the drives it previously has the message ‘BypassIO is not supported due to driver: aksdf’ against"
  caption="That looks better (except the F: drive, of course)"
  class="limit-height-slightly"
/>

Even with the driver removed, X-Rite i1Profiler seems to work fine for me. (Of
course, that’s far less likely if your licence for i1Profiler is on a dedicated
USB dongle. If that’s the case for you, you may have luck reinstalling the
latest Sentinel drivers, as that will leave out `aksdf.sys` and other legacy
drivers if they were previously removed. That will only work if i1Profiler can
recognise dongles without the legacy drivers, of course…)

## Aside – what is going on with my F:\ drive?

You may have noticed that the Game Bar screenshots above say that BypassIO is
unavailable on my F: drive due to the `ntfs` driver. That sounds a bit weird,
doesn’t it?

Luckily, the `fsutil` command-line tool can be used to get a bit more detail
about why BypassIO is unsupported.

For a drive affected by `aksdf.sys`, it reports:

```shell
> fsutil bypassio state C:\
BypassIo on "C:\" is not currently supported
    Status:  506 (At least one minifilter does not support bypass IO)
    Driver:  aksdf
    Reason:  The specified minifilter does not support bypass IO.
    Storage Type:   NVMe
    Storage Driver: Not BypassIo Compatible
```

And for my F: drive, it reports:

```shell
> fsutil bypassio state F:\
> BypassIo on "F:\" is not currently supported

    Status:  335 (The specified operation is not supported on a compressed file)
    Driver:  ntfs.sys
    Reason:  Compressed file not supported
    Storage Type:   NVMe
    Storage Driver: BypassIo compatible
```

The problem is that I had at some point enabled compression on my F: drive.

`fsutil` also allows you to query specific paths, though. If I pass it the path
of an uncompressed directory on my F: drive, it reports that BypassIO is
supported:

```shell
> fsutil bypassio state F:\test\
> BypassIo on "F:\test\" is currently supported

    Storage Type:   NVMe
    Storage Driver: BypassIo compatible
```

So, I can probably keep my F: drive compressed if I want and just turn off
compression on directories where BypassIO might be needed (such as directories
containing game files).

## Aside – what is BypassIO?

The
[documentation for BypassIO](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows-hardware/drivers/storage/bypassio)
says:

> BypassIO is an optimized I/O path for reading from files. The goal of this
> path is to reduce the CPU overhead of doing reads, which helps to meet the I/O
> demands of loading and running next-generation games on Windows. BypassIO is a
> part of the infrastructure to support DirectStorage on Windows, and is
> available starting in Windows 11.
>
> It's important that storage drivers implement support for BypassIO, and that
> you keep BypassIO enabled as much as possible. Without storage stack support,
> game performance is degraded, resulting in a poor gaming experience for end
> users.
>
> There will be broader application uses beyond gaming in future Windows
> releases.

That quote mentions DirectStorage. The
[Windows documentation for DirectStorage](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectStorage/blob/main/README.md)[^4]
(peculiarly, for Microsoft, on GitHub only) has an explanation of what
DirectStorage is:

> DirectStorage is a feature intended to allow games to make full use of
> high-speed storage (such as NVMe SSDs) that can can [sic] deliver multiple
> gigabytes a second of small (eg 64kb [sic]) data reads with minimal CPU
> overhead. Although it is possible to saturate a drive using traditional
> ReadFile-based IO the CPU overhead of increases non-linearly as the size of
> individual reads decreases. Additionally, most games choose to store their
> assets compressed on disk in order to reduce the install footprint, with these
> assets being decompressed on the fly as load time. The CPU overhead of this
> becomes increasingly expensive as bandwidth increases.

Various articles online suggest that take-up of DirectStorage has been low,
however, so I’m not at all clear how much BypassIO compatibility really matters.

    [old web pages about HASP are on the Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20050118020150/http://www.aladdin.com/hasp/default.asp)

[^2]:
    Although this is perhaps not easy to do automatically, as other software
    could be using the drivers. Still, an entry for the drivers in the Installed
    apps list could be added so they can at least be uninstalled manually.

[^3]:
    Note that this newer version of the driver installer doesn’t list an older
    driver named `hardlock.sys` in this dialogue box, but the `-purge` command
    correctly removes that driver as well.
