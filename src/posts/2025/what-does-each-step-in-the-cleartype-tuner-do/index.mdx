There’s a utility named ClearType Text Tuner that comes with Windows. It can be
found by searching for ‘Adjust ClearType Text’ in the Start Menu or the Settings
app, or by running `cttune.exe` directly.

The utility takes you through a series of steps that adjust how text is
rendered. Most of the steps ask you to select the text sample that looks the
best from a selection. The process seems well-intentioned. However, I always
found it difficult to pick between the different text samples. For the most
part, the text just looks different – it’s not easy to decide which one looks
the best. And the utility never tells you what to look for or what exactly you
are adjusting on each page.

As I’ve been using the
[DirectWrite API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/win32/directwrite/introducing-directwrite)
recently, I became more interested in what settings the tuner was adjusting
(partly to understand how they affect my software, and to check if my software
is doing the right thing).

I found
[some useful information about some of the settings](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/dotnet/desktop/wpf/advanced/cleartype-registry-settings)
in the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) documentation. And the DirectWrite
API documentation has
[some information about the various parameters](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/win32/api/dwrite/nn-dwrite-idwriterenderingparams).
But there was little information online about what each step in the ClearType
Text Tuner is changing.[^1] So, I set about working it out myself, and here’s
what I documented.

(If you’re unfamiliar with ClearType in general, the
[ClearType article on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ClearType) has
some background information.)

## The steps

### 1. Make the text on your screen easier to read

The first step contains a single option – ‘Turn on ClearType’:

<CaptionedImage
  src={_1_turn_on_cleartype}
  alt="A screenshot of the initial step of the ClearType Text Tuner, containing a ‘Turn on ClearType’ checkbox and a text sample."
/>

That sounds fairly self-explanatory. I’d point out, though, that turning off
ClearType doesn’t turn off text anti-aliasing completely. There’s another
(somewhat buried) setting named ‘Smooth edges of screen fonts’ that’s meant to
control that. (You can get to that setting by searching for and selecting ‘View
advanced system settings’ in the Start Menu and clicking on the ‘Settings…’
button under Performance.)

‘Turn on ClearType’ changes the registry value `FontSmoothingType` under the key
`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop`. If ClearType is on, the value is set
to `2`, and if it’s off, the value is set to `1`.

(The other ‘Smooth edges of screen fonts’ setting changes the `FontSmoothing`
value – `2` means on, and `0` means off.[^2])

### 2. Do you want to tune all monitors now?

Some settings the tuner sets are per monitor. So, if your desktop extends over
multiple displays, you’ll be asked to select which ones you want to adjust
settings for:

<CaptionedImage
  src={_2_select_monitors}
  alt="A screenshot of the ClearType Text Tuner, asking whether to tune all monitors, or specific ones."
/>

If you only have a single display (or e.g. cloned displays), this step will be
skipped.

(If you are tuning ClearType for multiple displays, I’d do them one at a time,
as the ClearType Text Tuner does not support per-monitor display scaling.)

### 3. Windows is making sure your monitor is set to its native resolution…

If your monitor is set to its native resolution, you’ll see this:

<CaptionedImage
  src={_3a_native_resolution}
  alt="A screenshot of the initial step of the ClearType Text Tuner, saying the monitor is set to its native resolution."
/>

If for some reason your monitor is not set to its native resolution, the tuner
will instead offer to change that:

<CaptionedImage
  src={_3b_not_native_resolution}
  alt="A screenshot of the initial step of the ClearType Text Tuner, saying the monitor is not set to its native resolution, and offering to change the monitor to its native resolution."
/>

### 4. Click the text sample that looks the best to you (1 of 5)

<CaptionedImage
  src={_4_best_to_you_1}
  alt="A screenshot of the initial step of the ClearType Text Tuner, asking which of two text samples looks best."
/>

In this step, you’re selecting the subpixel layout of your display. The option
on the left is for RGB, while the option on the right is BGR.

The pixel density of my monitor is too high for me to tell the difference with
the naked eye. However, the difference is visible with some macro photos.

Here’s a close-up of the text in the first option (RGB):

<CaptionedImage
  src={rgb}
  alt="A close-up photo of the text in the first option, showing the subpixels of the words ‘Brown Fox’."
/>

And here’s a close-up of the text in the second option (BGR):

<CaptionedImage
  src={bgr}
  alt="A close-up photo of the text in the second option, showing the subpixels of the words ‘Brown Fox’."
/>

You may be able to see that the subpixels of my monitor are ordered red, green
and then blue, and that in the BGR photo there is colour down the middle of the
stem of the letter r.

This step sets three registry values. The first is `FontSmoothingOrientation`
under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop`. For this one, `1` means RGB,
and `0` means BGR.

The second value is a per-display value. It’s named `PixelStructure` and is
under the `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Avalon.Graphics\<display name>`
key (where `<display name>` is a value like `DISPLAY1`, corresponding to the
display being tuned). The third value is the same as the second one, but under
`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE` instead. For these values, `1` means RGB and `2` means BGR.

And although it wasn’t an option in the tuner, `PixelStructure` can also be set
to `0` (meaning ‘flat’, and causing greyscale anti-aliasing to be used).

### 5. Click the text sample that looks the best to you (2 of 5)

<CaptionedImage
  src={_5_best_to_you_2}
  alt="A screenshot of the initial step of the ClearType Text Tuner, asking which of six text samples looks best."
/>

This step sets the `FontSmoothingGamma` registry value under the
`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop` key.

The ClearType Text Tuner has seven options – `1000`, `1200`, `1400`, `1600`,
`1800`, `2000` and `2200`. However, you only see six of the seven options – the
first or last is omitted, depending on the current value of the setting.

Now, while the name of that registry value has ‘Gamma’ in it, in the Win32 API
the same parameter is called contrast. Here’s what
[the Windows GDI documentation says](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/win32/gdi/cleartype-antialiasing)
about it:

> You can adjust the appearance of text by changing the contrast value used in
> the ClearType algorithm. The default is 1,400, but it can be any value from
> 1,000 to 2,200. Depending on the display device and the user's sensitivity to
> colors, a higher or lower contrast value may improve readability.

(Despite what that quote says, the tuner seems to treat 1200 as the default.)

If you’re tuning multiple displays, this step only appears for the first one.

### 6. Click the text sample that looks the best to you (3 of 5)

For the remainder of the steps, the tuner does not preselect the currently
configured values – it instead always defaults to the same options.

<CaptionedImage
  src={_6_best_to_you_3}
  alt="A screenshot of the initial step of the ClearType Text Tuner, asking which of three text samples looks best."
/>

This step sets the `ClearTypeLevel` value under
`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Avalon.Graphics\<display name>` to `100`,
`50`, or `0`. (This and the remaining steps do not set anything under
`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE`.)

The
[WPF documentation says](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/dotnet/desktop/wpf/advanced/cleartype-registry-settings#cleartype-level)
(specifically about the registry value):

> The ClearType level allows you to adjust the rendering of text based on the
> color sensitivity and perception of an individual. For some individuals, the
> rendering of text that uses ClearType at its highest level does not produce
> the best reading experience.
>
> The ClearType level is an integer value that ranges from 0 to 100. The default
> level is 100, which means ClearType uses the maximum capability of the color
> stripe elements of the display device. However, a ClearType level of 0 renders
> text as gray scale. By setting the ClearType level somewhere between 0 and
> 100, you can create an intermediate level that is suitable to an individual's
> color sensitivity.

And the
[DirectWrite documentation says](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/win32/api/dwrite/nf-dwrite-idwriterenderingparams-getcleartypelevel):

> The ClearType level represents the amount of ClearType – that is, the degree
> to which the red, green, and blue subpixels of each pixel are treated
> differently.

(Note that DirectWrite divides the registry value by 100, so 50 becomes 0.5, for
example.)

### 7. Click the text sample that looks the best to you (4 of 5)

<CaptionedImage
  src={_7_best_to_you_4}
  alt="A screenshot of the initial step of the ClearType Text Tuner, asking which of six text samples looks best."
/>

This setting sets two registry values under
`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Avalon.Graphics\<display name>`.

The first one is `EnhancedContrastLevel`.
[The DirectWrite documentation says](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/win32/api/dwrite/nf-dwrite-idwriterenderingparams-getenhancedcontrast),
‘Enhanced contrast is the amount to increase the darkness of text’. As far as
I’ve observed, it’s mainly relevant for dark text on a light background (and it
has little or no effect on white text on a black background). The six options
set the value to `0`, `50`, `100`, `200`, `300` and `400` respectively.
(DirectWrite again divides the registry value by 100 here.)

The second value set is `TextContrast`. The
[WPF documentation says](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/dotnet/desktop/wpf/advanced/cleartype-registry-settings#text-contrast-level)
that the ‘text contrast level allows you to adjust the rendering of text based
on the stem widths of glyphs’. The six options set this value to `0`, `0`, `1`,
`1`, `1` and `2` respectively. (However, the WPF documentation says that the
range is 0 to 6.)

### 8. Click the text sample that looks the best to you (5 of 5)

<CaptionedImage
  src={_8_best_to_you_5}
  alt="A screenshot of the initial step of the ClearType Text Tuner, asking which of six text samples looks best."
/>

This setting sets the `GrayscaleEnhancedContrastLevel` registry value under
`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Avalon.Graphics\<display name>`.

This is a contrast enhancement setting specifically for greyscale antialiasing.
(And the DirectWrite documentation
[does not say anything else about it](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/win32/api/dwrite_1/nf-dwrite_1-idwriterenderingparams1-getgrayscaleenhancedcontrast).)

The six options set the value to `0`, `50`, `100`, `200`, `300` and `400`
respectively.

### 9. You have finished tuning the text on this monitor

<CaptionedImage
  src={_9_finish_monitor}
  alt="A screenshot of the initial step of the ClearType Text Tuner, saying that tuning of the current monitor is finished, and to click ‘Next’ to tune the next monitor."
/>

If you selected the option to tune multiple displays, you’ll be shown this step.
The tuner will then go through the previous steps for the additional display
starting from the native resolution check (and skipping the step that sets
`FontSmoothingGamma`).

### 10. You have finished tuning the text on your monitor(s)

<CaptionedImage
  src={_10_finish_all}
  alt="A screenshot of the initial step of the ClearType Text Tuner, saying that tuning of all monitors is finished."
/>

After all monitors have been tuned, you’ll be shown this final step. Only when
‘Finish’ is clicked are the changes committed to the registry.

## The tuner sets another registry value

The tuner also sets the per-monitor `Gamma` values under
`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Avalon.Graphics\<display name>` and
`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Avalon.Graphics\<display name>`. It seems
to automatically work out the number to use from the environment and display
properties. (For my desktop, it sets the per-monitor gamma value to `2200`,
meaning 2.2, while in a virtual machine it set it to `1800`.)

Regarding gamma,
[the Windows Presentation Foundation documentation says](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/dotnet/desktop/wpf/advanced/cleartype-registry-settings#gamma-level):

> The gamma level refers to the nonlinear relationship between a pixel value and
> luminance. The gamma level setting should correspond to the physical
> characteristics of the display device; otherwise, distortions in rendered
> output may occur. For example, text may appear too wide or too narrow, or
> color fringes may appear on the edges of vertical stems of glyphs.

And
[the DirectWrite documentation says](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/win32/api/dwrite/nf-dwrite-idwriterenderingparams-getgamma):

> The gamma value is used for gamma correction, which compensates for the
> non-linear luminosity response of most monitors.

(Note that if the registry value doesn’t exist, DirectWrite seems to use 1.8.
So, if the value is not currently set, it can be worth going through the tuner
once just to set it.)

## Other things to note

All the above is what I’ve observed while experimenting with the tuner. It’s
possible that it can do other things in scenarios that I haven’t encountered.
And older or newer versions of the tuner may behave differently (I primarily
tested on Windows 11 24H2).

Another point to note is that different applications, and even different parts
of the same application (such as in File Explorer), will be affected by
different settings. It depends on the text rendering API the application uses
and how the application uses that API. As far as I know, the
`FontSmoothingGamma` value under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop` will
only affect applications using GDI to render text. And all the values under
`Avalon.Graphics` are primarily relevant for applications using DirectWrite or
WPF. (And some applications using DirectWrite may not support the per-monitor
parameters correctly and just use the values for the primary display.)

There are also limited notifications when the ClearType Text Tuner changes
settings, so you may need to close and reopen some apps after clicking the final
‘Finish’ button to see the effect.

Lastly,
[Microsoft recommends greyscale anti-aliasing for their newer app technologies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/win32/directwrite/introducing-directwrite#improved-text-rendering-with-cleartype),
so you’ll see newer functionality in Windows using greyscale anti-aliasing
rather than ClearType (confusingly, though, there are still relevant settings
set by the ClearType Text Tuner).

    There was a
    [promising StackExchange question](https://superuser.com/questions/930115/cleartype-text-tuner-what-exactly-do-all-steps-do).
    Alas, it was closed as a duplicate of a fairly unrelated question (which
    doesn’t even contain a question).

[^2]: No, I don’t know what a value of `1` means here.
