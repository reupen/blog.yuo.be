I liked Civilization V. And I liked Civilization VI. And so I was looking
forward to Civilization VII enough to pre-order it, and play it a few days ahead
of general release.

Alas, that decision to pre-order it was probably a mistake. Like many others, my
main problem with the game is the unpolished and unfinished UI.

My first, and largest annoyance, is the lack of control over UI scaling. The
choice you’re given is to scale the UI, or to not scale the UI. At a 4k
resolution, you’re picking between everything being massive:

<CaptionedImage
  src={ui_scaled_avif}
  alt="An in-game screenshot of Civilization VII with scaling on, showing the city build menu taking up a third of the screen."
>
  So much scrolling in that list
</CaptionedImage>

...or being tiny:

<CaptionedImage
  src={ui_unscaled_avif}
  alt="An in-game screenshot of Civilization VII with scaling of, showing the city build menu taking up a ninth of the screen."
>
  I’m starting to think Goldilocks was misunderstood
</CaptionedImage>

Maybe the font scale setting will help? Nope! With UI scaling on and font scale
on extra small, everything is still too big (just with more empty space). And
with UI scaling off and font scale on extra large, all the controls are still
too small, while the text starts to have problems in places due to fixed
positioning:

<CaptionedImage
  src={large_font_touching_text_png}
  alt="A screenshot of city yields without any space between some of the values."
>
  That’s not how spacing is meant to work, Firaxis
</CaptionedImage>

Scaling, though, isn’t the only UI problem. My next annoyance is that something
about the text style and rendering often makes it horrible to read. Take the
screen that shows when you start or resume a game:

<CaptionedImage
  src={continue_game_avif}
  alt="A screenshot of the main game loading screen containing lots of text."
>
  This screen really needs a bit of design thought into the layout
</CaptionedImage>

For some reason, someone’s fiddled with the character spacing of the second and
third paragraphs, while managing to leave the first paragraph alone. Compare the
‘the’ from the first and second paragraphs, for example:

<CaptionedImage
  src={the_spacing_png}
  alt="A screenshot comparing the rendering of the word ‘the’ from the first and second paragraph."
>
  Why?
</CaptionedImage>

The journal text, meanwhile, sometimes clashes with the map:

<CaptionedImage
  src={journal_avif}
  alt="A screenshot of showing the journal text clashing with the game map."
>
  Did anyone put any thought into that ‘Turns remaining’ text?
</CaptionedImage>

And there are frequent text alignment, positioning and spacing problems. Here’s
a screenshot of the pantheon selection screen with various problems highlighted:

<CaptionedImage
  src={pantheon_avif}
  alt="A screenshot of ‘Select a pantheon’ screen showing various text alignment and spacing problem."
>
  Weird alignment and spacing problems are scattered throughout the game
</CaptionedImage>

In that one screenshot, you have graphics overlapping text, dodgy word wrapping,
an icon messing up line spacing, and some uneven spacing around that same icon.

And, here’s a video of me scrolling a list and the map at the same time with the
mouse wheel:

<figure>
  <video width="2560" autoPlay controls loop muted playsInline>
    <source src={scrolling_mp4} type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
  <figcaption>I usually prefer to scroll one thing at a time</figcaption>
</figure>

So far, the actual game mechanics seen decent. But this is still spoiled by
poorly thought-out interactions. It took me a while to work out how to make
friends with an independent power, because I wasn’t clicking where it wanted me
to (clicking on the hex title itself brings up the relevant screen, but clicking
on the floating name banner above the tile does nothing).

Another example is the game yelling ‘SETTLEMENT IS IN UNREST!’ Okay, but what
can I do about it? Maybe the Civilopedia will tell me? _Nope, there’s no entry
for unrest._

And there was this odd and pointless bit of dialogue I got after negotiating
peace with Xerxes:

<CaptionedImage
  src={excuse_me_avif}
  alt="A screenshot of the screen showing dialogue between two leaders, with Xerxes saying ‘Indeed. Now if you will excuse me’"
>
  And, of course, the continue button text is misaligned
</CaptionedImage>

I hope the game improves over time. But it’s not worth the up to £120 asking
price in its current state, and I doubt I’ll be playing it much until it’s had
some needed polish.
