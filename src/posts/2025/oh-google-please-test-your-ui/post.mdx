import { CaptionedImage } from "@/components"

import chrome_bad_menu_mp4 from "./chrome-bad-menu.mp4"
import date_range_png from "./date-range.png"
import google_search_menu_mp4 from "./google-search-menu.mp4"
import google_search_menu_png from "./google-search-menu.png"

I recently noticed that the ‘Tools’ part of the Google search results page had
changed. Previously, clicking the ‘Tools’ button opened a second row of
controls. Now, however, it’s now a menu like this:

<CaptionedImage
  src={google_search_menu_png}
  alt="A screenshot of the ‘Tools’ menu on the Google search results page."
  caption="At least I know where the total number of results has gone"
/>

Unfortunately, the new menu is a bit poor:

<figure>
  <video width="1170" autoPlay controls loop muted playsInline>
    <source src={google_search_menu_mp4} type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
  <figcaption>
    The Tools button itself also appears a second after everything else on the
    page has loaded
  </figcaption>
</figure>

The first problem is that, if your mouse pointer temporarily leaves the parent
menu item of a submenu, there’s no delay before the submenu is closed or another
submenu is opened. It means you have to move the mouse very precisely across to
get to the right submenu (while a diagonal motion would be more natural).

The second (and probably worse) problem is that the interactive areas of the
submenu items are wrong. When you hover near the bottom of an item, it thinks
you’re on the next item.

Out of interest, I tried the ‘Custom range…’ time period option:

<CaptionedImage
  src={date_range_png}
  alt="A screenshot of the ‘Customised date range’ dialogue box on the Google search results page."
  caption="This dialogue is a pain to use"
/>

Here they’ve managed to localise the title, but not the date format (it’s using
a US date format, rather than a UK one).

Going back to the menu itself, I was going to say that Google only needs to look
at their own web browser for a working implementation of a menu. Alas, I was
wrong:

<figure>
  <video width="1198" autoPlay controls loop muted playsInline>
    <source src={chrome_bad_menu_mp4} type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
  <figcaption>
    The three-dot (or kebab) menu in Chrome is better, but still bugged
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Here, there is a delay before submenus are opened and closed. However, if the
first item you reach in the submenu is a disabled item (including separators),
it decides to close the submenu anyway.

(Meanwhile, on Android, Google seem incessant on adding ever-longer menu
animations, while breaking longstanding behaviours like long-tapping on the
three-dots button in Chrome to refresh the page.)
