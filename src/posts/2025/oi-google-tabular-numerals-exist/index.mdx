import android_clock_tabular_mp4 from "./android-clock-tabular.mp4"

I opened the Clock app on my Pixel 8 the other day and the design had completely
changed. Some things are a bit nicer. Most notably, though, things are bigger
and more in your face.

To pick up on something notably worse, this is how the World clock screen now
behaves:

<figure>
  <video width="540" autoPlay controls loop muted playsInline>
    <source src={android_clock_tabular_mp4} type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
  <figcaption>
    Oi Google, should I make a post every time you update an app?
  </figcaption>
</figure>

The digits and the things directly below them jump around every second. It looks
as though there are two factors contributing to the problem (though the first is
the main one):

- not using
  [tabular figures](https://www.myfonts.com/pages/fontscom-learning-fontology-level-3-numbers-proportional-vs-tabular-figures)
  (an OpenType font feature supported by any decent font)
- updating the font size every second to fit a particular width

(The rest of the screen also has problems with spacing and alignment, but I’m
not planning on doing Google’s work for them…)
