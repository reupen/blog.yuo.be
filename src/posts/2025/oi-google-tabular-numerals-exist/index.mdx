  Another badly tested UI update.

import { CaptionedImage } from "@/components"

import _11_11_png from "./11-11.png"
import android_clock_tabular_mp4 from "./android-clock-tabular.mp4"
import lock_screen_png from "./lock-screen.png"

I opened the Clock app on my Pixel 8 the other day and the design had completely
changed. Some things are a bit nicer. Most notably, though, things are bigger
and more in your face.

To pick up on something notably worse, this is how the World clock screen now
behaves:

<figure>
  <video width="540" autoPlay controls loop muted playsInline>
    <source src={android_clock_tabular_mp4} type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
  <figcaption>
    Oi Google, should I make a post every time you update an app?
  </figcaption>
</figure>

The digits and the things directly below them jump around every second. It looks
as though there are two factors contributing to the problem (though the first is
the main one):

- not using
  [tabular figures](https://www.myfonts.com/pages/fontscom-learning-fontology-level-3-numbers-proportional-vs-tabular-figures)
  (an OpenType font feature supported by any decent font)
- updating the font size every second to fit a particular width

(The rest of the screen also has problems with spacing and alignment, but I’m
not planning on doing Google’s work for them…)

## 5 September update

And, in the latest Pixel Drop (that has a Material 3 Expressive redesign),
Google have done something similar to the lock screen clock:

<CaptionedImage
  src={lock_screen_png}
  alt="A screenshot of the lock screen clock on a Pixel 8 with the September 2025 Pixel Drop."
  caption="My poor eyes"
  class="limit-height"
/>

The clock is now unbalanced (the 1 is not centred under the 2), and the two
columns move closer and further apart depending on the width of the glyphs in
each column.

## 13 September update

And, here’s what 11:11 looks like on the lock screen:

<CaptionedImage
  src={_11_11_png}
  alt="A screenshot of the lock screen clock on a Pixel 8 with the September 2025 Pixel Drop, showing the time 11:11."
  caption="Squishity squash"
  class="limit-height"
/>
