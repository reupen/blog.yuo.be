  Change isn’t inherently bad. But I don’t things I interact with every day to suddenly become bugged.

import { CaptionedImage } from "@/components"

import after_clicking_mp4 from "./after-clicking.mp4"
import after_disappear_mp4 from "./after-disappear.mp4"
import after_flicker_mp4 from "./after-flicker.mp4"
import after_png from "./after.png"
import before_png from "./before.png"

A few weeks ago, taskbar item flyouts suddenly changed in my Windows 11
installation.

They used to look like this:

<CaptionedImage
  src={before_png}
  alt="A taskbar item flyout on an older version of Windows 11 including app-specific buttons."
  caption="The good old days"
/>

And now, they look like this:

<CaptionedImage
  src={after_png}
  alt="A taskbar item flyout on a newer version of Windows 11 including app-specific buttons."
  caption="The present, on a fully up-to-date Windows 11 24H2 installation"
/>

The first thing I noticed is that app-specific buttons look different. In
particular, the background colour of them has changed, and spacing has been
added between them. (Subjectively, it looks uglier to me, but that could be
forgiven if all else was OK.)

The next thing I noticed is that the font size of the title has increased. It’s
now, bizarrely, larger than the font size used in application title bars.

I also felt that the background of the flyout has changed. Comparing the two
screenshots, it does appear to be more of a solid colour now.

(Another thing I picked up on when comparing the screenshots is that the icons
in the buttons are rendered differently. I’m ignoring that for now, as the first
screenshot was taken in a virtual machine and so there could be some other
explanation for it.)

Those aren’t the only differences, though. The next thing I noticed is that the
app buttons flicker a lot. Here’s that happening for Microsoft’s own Media
Player:

<figure>
  <video height="358" width="394" autoPlay controls loop muted playsInline>
    <source src={after_flicker_mp4} type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
  <figcaption>
    And what is up with those blocky previous and next buttons?
  </figcaption>
</figure>

I also noticed that sometimes flyouts were disappearing while my mouse was over
them. I tracked down a cause of that – it happens if the mouse moves over a
button tooltip:

<figure>
  <video height="466" width="370" autoPlay controls loop muted playsInline>
    <source src={after_disappear_mp4} type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
  <figcaption>That should not be happening…</figcaption>
</figure>

Perhaps the worst bug is that sometimes clicking on the flyout does nothing[^1]:

<figure>
  <video height="872" width="750" autoPlay controls loop muted playsInline>
    <source src={after_clicking_mp4} type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
  <figcaption>…and neither should that</figcaption>
</figure>

Another problem is that you now don’t get a tooltip for truncated titles when
hovering over the thumbnail preview – you only get it when hovering over the
title itself.

There are various other smaller problems that I’m not going to bother listing.
The only improvement I’ve noticed is that tooltips are now dark themed when dark
mode is enabled in Windows.

When I first noticed the change, I checked the
[Windows 11, version 24H2 update history](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/topic/windows-11-version-24h2-update-history-0929c747-1815-4543-8461-0160d16f15e5).
There’s no mention of these changes at all. Sadly, the whole thing is lacking
testing, polish and attention to detail, and there’s no sign of any improvements
being on the way[^2].

    I checked the latest Windows Insider Canary Channel build in a virtual
    machine, and all the problems mentioned above are still present.
