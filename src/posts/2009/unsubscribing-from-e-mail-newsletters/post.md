  I thought I'd try my hand at this today and just found:
   * It slightly annoying when you are sent an e-mail confirming that you've
     unsubscribed (hello, I just told you I don't want your e-mails!)
   * Even worse, you're asked to log into an account that you never created in the
     first place. My best guess here is that I registered to some other site owned
     by the same company. Though their 'password reminder' e-mail still hasn't
     come through.....
