  I've discovered that right clicking on various parts of the taskbar/jumplist
  brings up some menus I find useful - so that's a great help.

  However, quite a few times when I only meant to click on the title bar of a
  maximised window I've accidentally restored it - maybe some use of
  SM_CXDRAG/SM_CYDRAG would be an idea here (?)

  Also, with regards to the UPEK Protector Suite issues, to be fair to them after
  some correspondence they've basically fixed most of the problems, so I have a
  working finge

some correspondence they've basically fixed most of the problems, so I have a
working fingerprint reader now ;)

The only other gripe I have at the moment is that there is far too much stuff in
the left pane of file open & save dialogs. I was quite happy with the way it was
in Vista where I had shortcuts to everything I needed.. but never mind.
