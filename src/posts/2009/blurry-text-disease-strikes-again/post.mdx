  A little while ago I wrote about how the Windows 7 RC jump lists are affected by
  such a problem. I decided to install Visual Studio 2010 Beta 1 and to my horror,
  it has also been struck by this illness in several places. Apparently something
  to do with that thing called WPF. Have a look at this over-sized blown up
  comparison of the main menu between VS2008 (top) and VS2010 Beta 1 (bottom):

Look at that N, p and r! The Intellisense drop-downs are also quite bad.

How anyone can think that is remotely acceptable is beyond me, though apparently
they are going to fix the Visual Studio problem for Beta 2.

kindly blew up my Windows 7 RC screenshot, and as you can see the problem is not
nearly as bad there:

not great, though. Seems like they might have fixed the Windows 7 issue in
builds after the RC, but the real test will be when the final version is out and
installed here...
