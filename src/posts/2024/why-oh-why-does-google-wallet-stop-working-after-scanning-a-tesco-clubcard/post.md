  Reliability is important for a mobile payments app. And so is just plain working.

The problem is not new. You’re in Tesco (a UK supermarket), and you bring up
your Tesco Clubcard (a loyalty card) in Google Wallet on your Google Pixel phone
and scan the Clubcard at the till. Then, you swipe back up to your payment card
and try to pay.

It doesn’t work. You have to swipe between cards a few times before contactless
payments start working again.

Am I alone? Nope, here’s a thread from Reddit with a load of reports of this
(albeit not everyone has made the Clubcard link):

- [Gpay contactless in Tesco never works properly ??](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/192mrrj/gpay_contactless_in_tesco_never_works_properly/)

And here are some more reports from the Google Wallet Community (with
classically useless replies from ‘Diamond Product Experts’):

- [Opening Tesco clubcard breaks Google Wallet NFC](https://support.google.com/wallet/thread/241631841/opening-tesco-clubcard-breaks-google-wallet-nfc?hl=en)
- [Google pay works OK except in tescos](https://support.google.com/wallet/thread/269305483/google-pay-works-ok-except-in-tescos?hl=en)

The problem’s clearly on the device, and it’s hard not to believe that the
problem is in Google Wallet. Sort it out, Google.

(If it matters, I added my Clubcard to Google Wallet using the Tesco app. Real
Clubcards can also be used contactlessly, though there’s no indication that the
Clubcard in Google Wallet can be used that way...)

**Update 20 October 2024**

I haven’t had this problem for the past few visits to Tesco – it may be,
finally, fixed...

**Update 4 April 2025**

This, unfortunately, has started happening again for me. When it happens, I use
one of two ways to fix it:

- turn off NFC and turn it back on again, and then reopen Google Wallet
- swipe to another payment card, wait a few seconds and then swipe back
