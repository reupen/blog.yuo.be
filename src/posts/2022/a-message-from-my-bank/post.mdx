I recently tried to move money between two accounts held with the same business
bank. I did everything as I usually would, using the relevant mobile banking
app. But after confirming the transfer, instead of a success message, I got
this:

}

Yes, that’s my bank returning an exception and Oracle database error straight to
my phone. (And not any exception, but a _MicroserviceException_.)

If you’re particularly observant, you may have worked out that the bank in
question is TSB – the same TSB that was
[in the news in 2018 following a botched migration between banking platforms](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TSB_Bank_(United_Kingdom)#Migration_to_the_Sabadell_Proteo_banking_platform>).

This isn’t the first time I’ve had this error; it’s happened a handful of times
over the last year and a half. Each time I’m left wondering if the transfer did
or did not happen (or worse: whether I still had the money at all).

Another amusing fact is that if you
[search Google for `com.bs.proteo`](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22com.bs.proteo%22),
it returns a handful of questions and posts (and even bits of code) from people
who presumably have worked on the code base.

Alas, I’m otherwise happy with the bank, so I haven’t been in any rush to move
my company to a different bank (although, I may well have another look round
having posted this).
