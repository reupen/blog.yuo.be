  Canon Europe has (or had) a printer rewards scheme called Print Rewards, where
  you earn points for printing and replacing ink cartridges. Those points can then
  be exchanged for things like photo paper.

  This morning I received this email from Canon:

  At least Canon Club is alliterativeOkay, no big deal I thought, I’ll just redeem

Canon Europe has (or had) a printer rewards scheme called Print Rewards, where

be exchanged for things like photo paper.

This morning I received this email from Canon:

    alt="PRINT REWARDS IS COMING TO AN END. Hi Reupen, From 14/10/2022, our Print Rewards program will be closing. Until then, you can still claim rewards like free photo paper and other creative media, plus exclusive discounts on other Canon gear. Any points you have must be redeemed before Print Rewards closes, so act fast."

Okay, no big deal I thought, I’ll just redeem my points. Expect, contrary to
what is said in the email, all the meaningful rewards have been removed, and
only these are left:

Previously, 500 points would’ve got me a pack of pro A4 photo paper, and 1000
points a pack of pro A3 photo paper. But all those options are gone, and there
are only a few discounts on oddball products (which aren’t even things that can
be used with an existing printer).

‘The 50% off a camera bag doesn’t sounds that bad’, I thought. Except there’s
only a single camera bag in stock on the Canon UK online shop, and it’s a tiny
bag for compact cameras.

Perhaps you’re wondering what’s in this new Canon Club? More discounts, as it
turns out. These are the first two:

</figure>

The first code is completely useless, as photo paper is already 20% off in the
Canon UK online shop, and Canon discounts don’t stack. (In fact, the Zoemini is
also already discounted, so that reward in Printer Rewards is probably also
useless.)

And there’s also a promised 15% Lowepro discount in Canon Club – except that
when you click through, it’s only 5%.

Canon – sort it out.
