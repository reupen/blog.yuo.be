  I often would find myself confused by the scroll bar underneath the days in the forecast on the BBC Weather website. Sometimes it would look like the days were scrolled all the way to the right, when in fact they were scrolled all the way to the left:

I often would find myself confused by the scroll bar underneath the days in
[the forecast on the BBC Weather website](https://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/2643743).
Sometimes it would look like the days were scrolled all the way to the right,
when in fact they were scrolled all the way to the left:

<figure>
  <video
    src={bbc_weather_evening_mp4}
    height="1084"
    preload="metadata"
    width="2396"
    controls
    playsInline
  />
  <figcaption>On hover, the scroll bar is almost one solid colour</figcaption>
</figure>

But the behaviour wasn’t consistent. Sometimes the scroll bar colours would be
the expected way round, making me think the problem had been fixed, only for the
problem to return another day.

Eventually I worked out the pattern: it was the time of day. The scroll bar
colours are essentially reversed in the evening. But, if you switch to the
forecast for another date, the scroll bar colours change again!

Here’s that change in action:

<figure>
  <video
    src={bbc_weather_evening_switch_day_mp4}
    height="1086"
    preload="metadata"
    width="2384"
    controls
    playsInline
  ></video>
  <figcaption>My sanity was partially restored</figcaption>
</figure>

Still, the question of why the time of day was affecting the scroll bar colour
remained. Surely no one would do this deliberately?

There is, in fact, a factor other than the time of day that determines whether
this happens: which web browser you’re using. Both of the above videos were
taken in Firefox (on Windows 10). If you switch to Chrome, or Microsoft Edge,
the scroll bar colour is consistently normal, night or day.

I first assumed the scroll bar colour was being overridden using CSS, and I
checked the styles on the element for `scrollbar-color`. It wasn’t set. It
seemed there was some other indirect factor causing the odd behaviour.

With a bit more digging, I worked out what that factor was: the background
colour of one of the parent elements of the scrollable element. That background
colour, while normally hidden by a background image, changes by day and night.
That change in colour also causes the scroll bar colour to change.

This effect is shown here:

<figure>
  <video
    src={bbc_weather_background_affects_scroll_bar_mp4}
    height="1320"
    preload="metadata"
    width="3068"
    controls
    playsInline
  ></video>
  <figcaption>Now the scroll bar is normal, now it’s not</figcaption>
</figure>

I’m pretty sure this behaviour has been there for more than a couple of years.
Perhaps, I’m just the last person using Firefox for BBC Weather.

I still wondered why the evening scroll bar wasn’t darker than it was (and more
like a typical dark mode scroll bar). As it turns out, it’s because the
background colour of the parent of that element also determines the scroll bar
colour. If you set that colour to black when the evening colours are active, you
do get something closer to a normal dark mode scroll bar (albeit still looking
odd):

  <PostImage
    src={image_1_png}
    alt="An image further showing a further change in the scroll bar colour after the background colour of an element higher in the tree was changed"
