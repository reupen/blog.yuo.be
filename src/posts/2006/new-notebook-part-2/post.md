  Well, I decided against buying the Acer models since whilst stock is now
  available, I don't think their build quality is up to scratch. The Samsungs X60s
  mentioned still haven't turned up!

  Now I am considering the following:
  Philips X56 [http://www.currys.co.uk/martprd/product/seo/803207] - reasonable
  spec and very good price for a 12" notebook.
  Asus V1Jp
  [http://www.nexus13.com/productcart/pc/viewPrd.asp?idcategory=188%20&idproduct=996]
  - top spec 15.4" notebook but no stock anywhere!

Well, I decided against buying the Acer models since whilst stock is now
available, I don't think their build quality is up to scratch. The Samsungs X60s
mentioned still haven't turned up!

Now I am considering the following:

- [Philips X56](http://www.currys.co.uk/martprd/product/seo/803207) - reasonable

- [Asus V1Jp](http://www.nexus13.com/productcart/pc/viewPrd.asp?idcategory=188%20&idproduct=996) -
  top spec 15.4" notebook but no stock anywhere!

The Philips is very tempting, but on the otherhand its apparently a rebadged
Twinhead notebook, and support/drivers/BIOS updates etc. are non existant!

So, erm, back to square one I guess?
