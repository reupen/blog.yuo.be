  ...is apparently impossible? I just want a notebook with a dual-core x64 CPU
  (i.e. Turion X2 or Core 2 Duo), WSXGA(+) 14/15.4" screen, reasonable spec which
  includes some reasonable graphics card. I guess I must be in the minority..

  So far I have only found about four matches:

  Samsung X60 MWM
  [http://www.savastore.com/productinfo/product.aspx?catalog_name=Savastore&product_id=10291210&pid=44&rstrat=0]
   * Core 2 Duo T7200 2 GHz, 1GB RAM, 100GB hard drive, 15.4" WSXGA+ screen, ATI
     Mobility Ra

The Acer models seem overpriced compared to the (first) Samsung model, £1550
seems like too much. But that's not exactly the main problem. Did I mention that
none of these models are actually in stock on any UK website?

If you have any suggestions for a good laptop model that roughly matches my
requirements feel free to leave it as a comment below. Lookout for an update
when I buy my new laptop!
