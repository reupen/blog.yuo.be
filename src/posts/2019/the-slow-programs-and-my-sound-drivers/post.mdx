  I recently noticed that some programs on my Windows PC were taking a long time
  to start. I knew, for example, foobar2000 should start instantly. And yet, it
  was frustratingly taking several seconds. I then realised that other programs
  were affected: Firefox and Chrome were also taking a long time to start. I

I recently noticed that some programs on my Windows PC were taking a long time
to start. I knew, for example, foobar2000 should start instantly. And yet, it
was frustratingly taking several seconds. I then realised that other programs
were affected: Firefox and Chrome were also taking a long time to start. I
started investigating.

I used Microsoft’s
[Process Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon)
to log what foobar2000 was doing when it was starting. To my surprise, it spent
much time accessing registry keys relating to something called Nahimic:

    />
  </a>

I recognised this as software that came with the audio drivers for my Asus
motherboard. In fact, I had previously seen the word ‘Nahimic’ come up in a
foobar2000 crash log:

```

Versions of Nahimic
[had also been installed by Windows](https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=a-volute):

  />
  <figcaption>
    These cryptically-named driver packages contained the Nahimic software

I went to Task Manager to check what Nahimic-related processes and services were
running. I found five processes (of which one was a service):

</figure>

I stopped the service and killed the other Nahimic processes that were still
running. I checked my programs: once again, they started instantly.

I then searched Google and
[quickly found similar Nahimic complaints from others](https://rog.asus.com/forum/showthread.php?107802-Nahimic-Service-causing-programs-to-startup-slow).
I also found reported fixes –
[most recently this one that mysteriously only exists in a quote](<https://rog.asus.com/forum/showthread.php?105341-DRIVERS-Realtek-HD-Audio-(UAD)/page71#post786895>).
That same thread also
[contains, again only in a quote, an explanation of what Nahimic is](<https://rog.asus.com/forum/showthread.php?105341-DRIVERS-Realtek-HD-Audio-(UAD)#post738112>):

(The terminology there is perhaps a bit confusing: I didn’t have the Sonic
Studio software itself installed.)

The reported fix indirectly suggests that recent versions of Nahimic don’t
suffer from this slow down. Nonetheless, I wasn’t keen on having this software
on my PC. I uninstalled and
[removed all traces of my motherboard’s sound drivers](https://github.com/lostindark/DriverStoreExplorer)
(leaving me with the default Microsoft driver). Nahimic was gone, hasn’t
returned, and my programs don’t take an age to start.
