  musicmusic’s foobar2000 stuff first appeared in 2003,
  as a website to host components I had written for the foobar2000 audio player. Hosted on free web host Lycos, it’s address was
  members.lycos.co.uk/musicf. The site’s design was simple and unassuming.

  The site was simply an HTML file that I had
  manually crafted. Some CSS was embedded in the page

musicmusic’s foobar2000 stuff
[first appeared in 2003](https://web.archive.org/web/20031222203115/http://members.lycos.co.uk/musicf/),
as a website to host components I had written for the
[foobar2000 audio player](https://foobar2000.org). Hosted on free web host
Lycos, it’s address was _members.lycos.co.uk/musicf_. The site’s design was
simple and unassuming:

<figure>
  <PostImage src={image_10_png} alt="A screenshot of the original site" />
  <figcaption>The original site, hosted on Lycos</figcaption>
</figure>

The site was simply an HTML file that I had manually crafted. Some CSS was
embedded in the page (curiously, partly in all caps and partly lower case), as
well as a small bit of JavaScript that hides and shows the Text writer change
log on click. Also of note is that the site had a textured background.

[In 2004](https://web.archive.org/web/20041205172954/http://music.everywebhost.com/),
the design of the site was slightly refined, and the textured background
removed. The CSS had been moved to a separate file. The site also moved to a
non-free shared hosting provider, with the URL changing to
_music.everywebhost.com_. It is also interesting to see that Album list panel
was open source at this point; I recall that the source code of the original
Album list component (that it was based on) was part of the foobar2000 SDK.

[In early 2005](https://web.archive.org/web/20050111025042/http://music.everywebhost.com:80/),
nested green boxes were introduced to organise expanding content about Columns
UI.
[In April 2005](https://web.archive.org/web/20050406013327/http://music.morbo.org/),
the nested boxes were dropped and the site was spread over multiple pages. Each
page shared a common side menu; PHP was introduced to achieve this. The site
also moved to _music.morbo.org_, after the owner of morbo.org kindly offered to
host my website following some problems with my previous host.
[By the end of 2005](https://web.archive.org/web/20051225023107/http://music.morbo.org/),
the site looked like this:

<figure>
  <PostImage
    src={image_11_png}
    alt="A screenshot of the home page of the late 2005 version of the site"
  />
  <figcaption>Blue was out, and lilac was in</figcaption>
</figure>

This colour scheme and design would prove to be short-lived.
[In early 2006](https://web.archive.org/web/20060407022014/http://music.morbo.org/),
the site underwent a more radical refresh:

<figure>
  <PostImage
    src={image_3_png}
    alt="A screenshot of the home page of the early 2006 version of the site"
  />
  <figcaption>This minimalist design is one of my favourites</figcaption>
</figure>

Colours were banished, and the Verdana font was dropped in favour of a return to
Tahoma. PHP was also now used to calculate file sizes for downloads.

In October 2006, the site moved again, but this time to a dedicated domain name:
_yuo.be_. This would become the site’s long-term home. The site also remained
largely unchanged in design
[until 2009](https://web.archive.org/web/20090609162200/http://yuo.be/), where
some of the minimalism was lost:

<figure>
  <PostImage
    src={image_4_png}
    alt="A screenshot of the home page of the 2009 version of the site"
  />
  <figcaption>Two-toned boxes were now in vogue</figcaption>
</figure>

[In 2015](https://web.archive.org/web/20150831053301/http://yuo.be/), the site
moved to AWS and CloudFlare, and underwent a Bootstrap-themed refresh:

<figure>
  <PostImage
    src={image_5_png}
    alt="A screenshot of the home page of the 2015 version of the site"
  />
  <figcaption>The site had a sticky header</figcaption>
</figure>

'foobar2000' was dropped from the name of the site (largely because of a lack of
space). This has remained the design of the site, until now.

## Rethinking the site: a new design

<figure>
  <PostImage
    src={image_17_png}
    alt="A screenshot of the home page of the new version of the site"
  />
  <figcaption>Back to basics</figcaption>
</figure>

I’ve, once again, redesigned the site. [The new site](https://yuo.be) opts for
simplicity, and focuses on logically organised content.

The change in design also coincides with a more radical change in technology.
The new site was built using [site generator Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)
and [CSS framework Bulma](https://bulma.io/). The site is written using
[React](https://reactjs.org/), [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) and
[Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) – but compiles to HTML, and works without
JavaScript. (But, if you do have JavaScript enabled, it magically turns into a
[single-page application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application).)

As a result, PHP is no longer used on the site, and caching works well out of
the box. And, despite the more static nature of the content, I was able to
retain the display of download file sizes.

The new site [is live at yuo.be](https://yuo.be/) and
[it’s source code has been published on GitHub](https://github.com/reupen/yuo.be).
Feel free to leave feedback in the comments or on GitHub. (If you encounter any
problems with the new site, the old site is temporarily available at
[old.yuo.be](https://old.yuo.be).)
