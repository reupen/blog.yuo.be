  Canon just released Vista compatible 32-bit and 64-bit drivers for my CanoScan
  4200F scanner. The old 32-bit drivers didn't work on Vista (and there were no
  64-bit drivers available previously). What's also good, is that the 64-bit
  drivers also work fine on Windows XP x64 Edition :-)

  The drivers are available from the American Canon website
  [http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=DownloadDetailAct&fcategoryid=351&modelid=10445]
  (they aren't up on the European site at the moment).
