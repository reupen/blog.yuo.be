As I like to note them, I just found another minor but annoying Vista bug.

Go to Control Panel / Power Options / Edit Plan Settings. Click on one of the

Probably mixed mouse and keyboard navigation like this is not so common, but I
use it pretty often on my laptop + touchpad. It's funny because VS2005 has same
bug in some places (e.g. project properties) - which I reported before it was
released but they refused to fix at the time because it was below their bar
(next release was release candidate or something). They didn't fix it in SP1 of
